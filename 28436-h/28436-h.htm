<h3>AN INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class="cenhead">TO THE STUDY OF</p>

<h2>THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

<h3>PART I.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">GENERAL ETHNOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF THE ENGLISH
LANGUAGE.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">GERMANIC ORIGIN OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</span>&mdash;<span class="scac">DATE.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect1">§ 1</a>. The first point to be remembered in the
  history of the English language, is that it was not the primitive and
  original tongue of any of the British Islands, nor yet of any portion of
  them. Indeed, of the <i>whole</i> of Great Britain it is not the language
  at the present moment. Welsh is spoken in Wales, Manks in the Isle of
  Man, and Scotch Gaelic in the Highlands of Scotland; besides which there
  is the Irish Gaelic in Ireland.</p>

  <p><a name="sect2">§ 2</a>. The next point to be considered is the real
  origin and the real affinities of the English language.</p>

  <p>Its <i>real</i> origin is on the continent of Europe, and its
  <i>real</i> affinities are with certain languages there spoken. To speak
  more specifically, the native country of the <!-- Page 2 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>[2]</span>English language is
  <i>Germany</i>; and the <i>Germanic</i> languages are those that are the
  most closely connected with our own. In Germany, languages and dialects
  allied to each other and allied to the mother-tongue of the English have
  been spoken from times anterior to history; and these, for most purposes
  of philology, may be considered as the aboriginal languages and dialects
  of that country.</p>

  <p><a name="sect3">§ 3</a>. <i>Accredited details of the different
  immigrations from Germany into Britain.</i>&mdash;Until lately the
  details of the different Germanic invasions of England, both in respect
  to the particular tribes by which they were made, and the order in which
  they succeeded each other, were received with but little doubt, and as
  little criticism.</p>

  <p>Respecting the tribes by which they were made, the current opinion
  was, that they were chiefly, if not exclusively, those of the Jutes, the
  Saxons, and the Angles.</p>

  <p>The particular chieftains that headed each descent were also supposed
  to be known, as well as the different localities upon which they
  descended.<sup>[<a name="endnotetag1" href="#endnote1">1</a>]</sup>
  These were as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>First settlement of invaders from Germany.</i>&mdash;The account of
  this gives us <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 449 for the first permanent
  Germanic tribes settled in Britain. Ebbsfleet, in the Isle of Thanet, was
  the spot where they landed; and the particular name that these tribes
  gave themselves was that of <i>Jutes</i>. Their leaders were Hengist and
  Horsa. Six years after their landing they had established the kingdom of
  Kent; so that the county of Kent was the first district where the
  original British was superseded by the mother-tongue of the present
  English, introduced from Germany. <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page3"></a>[3]</span></p>

  <p><i>Second settlement of invaders from Germany.</i>&mdash;<span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 477 invaders from Northern Germany made the
  second permanent settlement in Britain. The coast of Sussex was the spot
  whereon they landed. The particular name that these tribes gave
  themselves was that of <i>Saxons</i>. Their leader was Ella. They
  established the kingdom of the South Saxons (Sussex or Suð-Seaxe); so
  that the county of Sussex was the second district where the original
  British was superseded by the mother-tongue of the present English,
  introduced from Germany.</p>

  <p><i>Third settlement of invaders from Germany.</i>&mdash;<span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 495 invaders from Northern Germany made the third
  permanent settlement in Britain. The coast of Hampshire was the spot
  whereon they landed. Like the invaders last mentioned, these tribes were
  Saxons. Their leader was Cerdic. They established the kingdom of the West
  Saxons (Wessex or West-Seaxe); so that the county of Hants was the third
  district where the original British was superseded by the mother-tongue
  of the present English, introduced from Germany.</p>

  <p><i>Fourth settlement of invaders from Germany.</i>&mdash;<span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 530, certain Saxons landed in Essex, so that the
  county of Essex [East-Seaxe] was the fourth district where the original
  British was superseded by the mother-tongue of the present English,
  introduced from Northern Germany.</p>

  <p><i>Fifth settlement of invaders from Germany.</i>&mdash;These were
  <i>Angles</i> in Norfolk and Suffolk. The precise date of this settlement
  is not known. The fifth district where the original British was
  superseded by the mother-tongue of the present English was the counties
  of Norfolk and Suffolk; the particular dialect introduced being that of
  the <i>Angles</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Sixth settlement of invaders from Germany.</i>&mdash;<span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 547 invaders from Northern Germany made the
  sixth <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page4"></a>[4]</span>permanent settlement in Britain. The
  southeastern counties of Scotland, between the rivers Tweed and Forth,
  were the districts where they landed. They were of the tribe of the
  Angles, and their leader was Ida. The south-eastern parts of Scotland
  constituted the sixth district where the original British was superseded
  by the mother-tongue of the present English, introduced from Northern
  Germany,</p>

  <p><a name="sect4">§ 4</a>. It would be satisfactory if these details
  rested upon contemporary evidence. This, however, is far from being the
  case.</p>

  <p>1. <i>The evidence to the details just given, is not historical, but
  traditional.</i>&mdash;<i>a.</i> Beda,<sup>[<a name="endnotetag2"
  href="#endnote2">2</a>]</sup> from whom it is chiefly taken, wrote nearly
  300 years after the supposed event, <i>i.e.</i>, the landing of Hengist
  and Horsa, in <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 449.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> The nearest approach to a contemporary author is
  Gildas,<sup>[<a name="endnotetag3" href="#endnote3">3</a>]</sup> and
  <i>he</i> wrote full 100 years after it.</p>

  <p>2. <i>The account of Hengist's and Horsa's landing, has elements which
  are fictional rather than historical</i>&mdash;<i>a.</i> Thus "when we
  find Hengist and Horsa approaching the coasts of Kent in three keels, and
  Ælli effecting a landing in Sussex with the same number, we are reminded
  of the Gothic tradition which carries a migration of Ostrogoths,<sup>[<a
  name="endnotetag4" href="#endnote4">4</a>]</sup> Visigoths, and Gepidæ,
  also in three vessels, to the mouth of the Vistula."&mdash;Kemble,
  "Saxons in England."</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> The murder of the British chieftains by Hengist is told
  <i>totidem verbis</i>, by Widukind<sup>[<a name="endnotetag5"
  href="#endnote5">5</a>]</sup> and others, of the Old Saxons in
  Thuringia.</p>

  <p><i>c.</i> Geoffry of Monmouth<sup>[<a name="endnotetag6"
  href="#endnote6">6</a>]</sup> relates also, how "Hengist obtained from
  the Britons as much land as could be enclosed by an ox-hide; then,
  cutting the hide into thongs, enclosed a much larger space than the
  granters intended, on which he erected Thong Castle&mdash;a tale too <!--
  Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>[5]</span>familiar to
  need illustration, and which runs throughout the mythus of many nations.
  Among the Old Saxons, the tradition is in reality the same, though
  recorded with a slight variety of detail. In their story, a lapfull of
  earth is purchased at a dear rate from a Thuringian; the companions of
  the Saxon jeer him for his imprudent bargain; but he sows the purchased
  earth upon a large space of ground, which he claims, and, by the aid of
  his comrades, ultimately wrests it from the Thuringians."&mdash;Kemble,
  "Saxons in England."</p>

  <p>3. <i>There is direct evidence in favour of their having been German
  tribes in England anterior to</i> <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  447.&mdash;<i>a.</i> At the close of the Marcomannic war,<sup>[<a
  name="endnotetag7" href="#endnote7">7</a>]</sup> Marcus Antoninus
  transplanted a number of Germans into Britain.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> Alemannic auxiliaries served along with Roman legions under
  Valentinian.<sup>[<a name="endnotetag8"
  href="#endnote8">8</a>]</sup></p>

  <p><i>c.</i> <i>The Notitia utriusque Imperii</i>,<sup>[<a
  name="endnotetag9" href="#endnote9">9</a>]</sup> of which the latest date
  is half a century earlier than the epoch of Hengist, mentions, as an
  officer of state, the <i>Comes littoris Saxonici per Britannias</i>; his
  government extending along the coast from Portsmouth to the Wash.</p>

  <p><a name="sect5">§ 5</a>. <i>Inference.</i>&mdash;As it is nearly
  certain, that 449 <span class="scac">A.D.</span> is <i>not</i> the date
  of the first introduction of German tribes into Britain, we must consider
  that the displacement of the original British began at an <i>earlier</i>
  period than the one usually admitted, and, consequently, that it was more
  <i>gradual</i> than is usually supposed.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, if we substitute the middle of the <i>fourth</i>, instead of
  the middle of the <i>fifth</i> century, as the epoch of the Germanic
  immigrations into Britain, we shall not be far from the truth.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">GERMANIC ORIGIN OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</span>&mdash;<span class="scac">THE GERMANIC AREA OF THE PARTICULAR GERMANS WHO INTRODUCED IT.</span>&mdash;<span class="scac">EXTRACT FROM BEDA.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect6">§ 6</a>. Out of the numerous tribes and nations of
  Germany, <i>three</i> have been more especially mentioned as the chief,
  if not the exclusive, sources of the present English population of Great
  Britain. These are the <i>Jutes</i>, the <i>Saxons</i>, and the
  <i>Angles</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect7">§ 7</a>. Now, it is by no means certain that this was
  the case. On the contrary, good reasons can be given for believing that
  the Angles and Saxons were the same people, and that no such nation as
  the <i>Jutes</i> ever left Germany to settle in Great Britain.</p>

  <p><a name="sect8">§ 8</a>. The chief authority for the division of the
  German invaders into the three nations just mentioned is Beda; and the
  chief text is the following extract from his "Ecclesiastical History." It
  requires particular attention, and will form the basis of much criticism,
  and frequently be referred to.</p>

  <p>"Advenerunt autem de tribus Germaniæ populis fortioribus, id est
  Saxonibus, Anglis, Jutis. De Jutarum origine sunt Cantuarii, et
  Victuarii, hoc est ea gens quæ Vectam tenet insulam et ea quæ usque hodie
  in provincia Occidentalium Saxonum Jutarum natio nominatur, posita contra
  ipsam insulam Vectam. De <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page7"></a>[7]</span>Saxonibus, id est, ea regione quæ nunc
  Antiquorum Saxonum cognominatur, venere Orientales Saxones, Meridiani
  Saxones, Occidui Saxones. Porro de Anglis hoc est de illa patria quæ
  Angulus dicitur, et ab illo tempore usque hodie manere desertus inter
  provincias Jutarum et Saxonum perhibetur, Orientales Angli, Mediterranei
  Angli, Merci, tota Northanhymbrorum progenies, id est illarum gentium quæ
  ad Boream Humbri fluminis inhabitant, cæterique Anglorum populi sunt
  orti"&mdash;"Historia Ecclesiastica," i. 15.</p>

  <p><a name="sect9">§ 9</a>. This was written about <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 731, 131 years after the introduction of
  Christianity, and nearly 300 after the supposed landing of Hengist and
  Horsa in <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 449.</p>

  <p>It is the first passage which contains the names of either the
  <i>Angles</i> or the <i>Jutes</i>. Gildas, who wrote more than 150 years
  earlier, mentions only the <i>Saxons</i>&mdash;"ferocissimi illi nefandi
  nominis <i>Saxones</i>."</p>

  <p>It is, also, the passage which all subsequent writers have either
  translated or adopted. Thus it re-appears in Alfred, and again in the
  Saxon Chronicle.<sup>[<a name="endnotetag10"

<p><!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>[8]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect10">§ 10</a>. A portion of these extracts will now be
  submitted to criticism; that portion being the statement concerning the
  <i>Jutes</i>.</p>

  <p>The words <i>usque hodie&mdash;Jutarum natio nominatur</i> constitute
  contemporary and unexceptionable evidence to the existence of a people
  with a name like that of the <i>Jutes</i> in the time of Beda&mdash;or
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 731.</p>

  <p>The exact name is not so certain. The term <i>Jutnacyn</i> from the
  Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is in favour of the notion that it began with the
  sounds of <i>j</i> and <i>u</i>, in other words that it was
  <i>Jut</i>.</p>

  <p>But the term <i>Geatum</i>, which we find in Alfred, favours the form
  in <i>g</i> followed by <i>ea</i>.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, the forms <i>Wihtware</i>, and <i>Wihttan</i>, suggest the
  likelihood of the name being <i>Wiht</i>.</p>

  <p>Lastly, there is a passage in Asserius<sup>[<a name="endnotetag11"
  href="#endnote11">11</a>]</sup> which gives us the form
  <i>Gwith</i>&mdash;"Mater" (of Alfred the Great) "quoque ejusdem Osburgh
  nominabatur, religiosa nimium f&oelig;mina, nobilis ingenio, nobilis et
  genere; quæ erat filia Oslac famosi pincernæ Æthelwulf regis; qui Oslac
  Gothus erat natione, ortus enim erat de Gothis et Jutis; de semine
  scilicet Stuf et Wihtgur, duorum fratrum et etiam comitum, qui acceptâ
  potestate Vectis insulæ ab avunculo suo Cerdic rege et Cynric filio suo,
  consobrino eorum, paucos Britones ejusdem insulæ accolas, quos in eâ
  invenire potuerant, in loco qui dicitur, <i>Gwithgaraburgh</i>
  occiderunt, cæteri enim accolæ ejusdem insulæ ante sunt occisi aut exules
  aufugerant."&mdash;Asserius, "De Gestis Alfredi Regis."</p>

  <p>Now, <i>Gwith-gara-burgh</i> means the <i>burg</i> or <i>town of</i>
  the <i>With-ware</i>;<sup>[<a name="endnotetag12"
  href="#endnote12">12</a>]</sup> these being, undoubtedly, no Germans at
  all, but the native Britons of the Isle of Wight (Vectis), whose
  designation in Latin would be <i>Vecticolæ</i> or <i>Vectienses</i>. <!--
  Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>[9]</span></p>

  <p>This being the case, how can they be descended from German or Danish
  <i>Jutes</i>? and how can we reconcile the statement of Beda with that of
  Asser?</p>

  <p><a name="sect11">§ 11</a>. The answer to this will be given after
  another fact has been considered.</p>

  <p>Precisely the same confusion between the sounds of <i>w</i>, <i>j</i>,
  <i>g</i>, <i>io</i>, <i>eæ</i>, <i>u</i>, and <i>i</i>, which occurs with
  the so-called <i>Jutes</i> of the Isle of Wight, occurs with the
  Jutlanders of the peninsula of Jutland. The common forms are
  <i>Jutland</i>, <i>Jute</i>, <i>Jutones</i>, and <i>Jutenses</i>, but
  they are not the only ones. In <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 952, we
  find "Dania cismarina quam <i>Vitland</i> incolæ
  appellant."&mdash;"Annales Saxonici."<sup>[<a name="endnotetag13"
  href="#endnote13">13</a>]</sup></p>

  <p><a name="sect12">§ 12</a>. Putting these facts together I adopt the
  evidence of Asser as to the <i>Gwithware</i> being British, and consider
  them as simple <i>Vecti-colæ</i>, or inhabitants of the Isle of
  <i>Wight</i>. They are also the <i>Vectuarii</i> of Beda, the
  <i>Wihtware</i> of the Saxon Chronicle, and the <i>Wihtsætan</i> of
  Alfred.</p>

  <p>The Jutes of Hampshire&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the "Jutarum
  natio&mdash;posita contra ipsam insulam Vectam," and the <i>Jutnacyn</i>,
  I consider to have been the same; except that they had left the Isle of
  Wight to settle on the opposite coast; probably flying before their
  German conquerors, in which case they would be the <i>exules</i> of
  Asser.</p>

  <p>The statement of Beda, so opposed to that of Asser, I explain by
  supposing that it arose out of an inaccurate inference drawn from the
  similarity of the names of the Isle of Wight and the peninsula of
  Jutland, since we have seen that in both cases, there was a similar
  confusion between the syllables <i>Jut-</i> and <i>Vit-</i>. This is an
  error into which even a careful writer might fall. That Beda had no
  authentic historical accounts of the conquest of Britain, we know from
  his own statements in the Preface to his Ecclesiastical History,<sup>[<a
  name="endnotetag14" href="#endnote14">14</a>]</sup> and that he <!-- Page
  10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>[10]</span>partially
  tried to make up for the want of them by inference is exceedingly likely.
  If so, what would be more natural than for him to conclude that Jutes as
  well as Angles helped to subdue the country. The fact itself was
  probable; besides which he saw at one and the same time, in England
  <i>Vitæ</i> (called also <i>Jutæ</i>), in immediate contact with
  <i>Saxons</i>,<a name="footnotetag26"
  href="#footnote26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> and on the continent <i>Jutæ</i>
  (called also <i>Vitæ</i>) in the neighborhood of Angles<a
  name="footnotetag27" href="#footnote27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> and Saxons.
  Is it surprising that he should connect them?</p>

  <p><a name="sect13">§ 13</a>. If the inhabitants of the Isle of Wight
  were really <i>Jutes</i> from <i>Jutland</i>, it is strange that there
  should be no traces of the difference which existed, then as now, between
  them and the proper Anglo-Saxons&mdash;a difference which was neither
  inconsiderable nor of a fleeting nature.</p>

  <p>The present Jutlanders are not Germans but Danes, and the Jutes of the
  time of Beda were most probably the same. Those of the 11th century were
  <i>certainly</i> so, "Primi ad ostium Baltici Sinus in australi ripa
  versus nos <i>Dani, quos Juthas appellant</i>, usque ad Sliam lacum
  habitant." Adamus Bremensis,<sup>[<a name="endnotetag15"
  href="#endnote15">15</a>]</sup> "De Situ Daniæ" c. 221. Also, "Et prima
  pars Daniæ, quæ Jutland dicitur, ad Egdoram<a name="footnotetag28"
  href="#footnote28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> in Boream longitudine pretenditur
  ... in eum angulum qui Windila dicitur, ubi Jutland finem habet," c.
  208.</p>

  <p>At the time of Beda they must, according to the received traditions,
  have been nearly 300 years in possession of the Isle of Wight, a locality
  as favourable for the preservation of their peculiar manners and customs
  as any in Great Britain, and a locality wherein we have no evidence of
  their ever having been disturbed. Nevertheless, neither trace nor shadow
  of a trace, either <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page11"></a>[11]</span>in early or modern times, has ever been
  discovered of their separate nationality and language; a fact which
  stands in remarkable contrast with the very numerous traces which the
  Danes of the 9th and 10th century left behind them as evidence of their
  occupancy.</p>

  <p><a name="sect14">§ 14</a>. The words <i>England</i> and <i>English</i>
  are derived from the <i>Angles</i> of Beda. The words <i>Sussex</i>,
  <i>Essex</i>, <i>Middlesex</i> and <i>Wessex</i>, from his <i>Saxons</i>.
  No objection lies against this; indeed to deny that populations called
  <i>Angle</i> and <i>Saxon</i> occupied <i>England</i> and spoke the
  <i>Anglo-Saxon</i> language would display an unnecessary and unhealthy
  scepticism. The real question concerning these two words consists in the
  relation which the populations to which they were applied bore to each
  other. And this question is a difficult one. Did the Angles speak one
  language, whilst the Saxons spoke another? or did they both speak
  dialects of the same tongue? Were these dialects slightly or widely
  different? Can we find traces of the difference in any of the present
  provincial dialects? Are the idioms of one country of Angle, whilst those
  of another are of Saxon origin? Was the Angle more like the Danish
  language, whilst the Saxon approached the Dutch? None of these questions
  can be answered at present. They have, however, been asked for the sake
  of exhibiting the nature of the subject.</p>

  <p><a name="sect15">§ 15</a>. The extract from Beda requires further
  remarks.</p>

  <p><i>The Angles of Beda.</i>&mdash;The statement of Beda respecting the
  Angles, like his statement concerning the Jutes, reappears in the
  Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and in Alfred.</p>

  <p>Ethelweard<sup>[<a name="endnotetag16"
  href="#endnote16">16</a>]</sup> also adopts it:&mdash;"<i>Anglia
  vetus</i> sita est inter Saxones et Giotos, habens oppidum capitale quod
  <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page12"></a>[12]</span>sermone Saxonico <i>Sleswic</i> nuncupatur,
  secundum vero Danos <i>Hathaby</i>."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it is exceptionable and unsatisfactory; and like the
  previous one, in all probability, an incorrect inference founded upon the
  misinterpretation of a name.</p>

  <p>In the eighth century there <i>was</i>, and at the present moment
  there <i>is</i>, a portion of the duchy of Sleswick called <i>Anglen</i>
  or <i>the corner</i>. It is really what its name denotes, a triangle of
  irregular shape, formed by the Slie, the firth of Flensborg, and a line
  drawn from Flensborg to Sleswick. It is just as Danish as the rest of the
  peninsula, and cannot be shown to have been occupied by a Germanic
  population at all. Its area is less than that of the county of Rutland,
  and by no means likely to have supplied such a population as that of the
  Angles of England. The fact of its being a desert at the time of Beda is
  credible; since it formed a sort of <i>March</i> or <i>Debatable
  Ground</i> between the Saxons and Slavonians of Holstein, and the Danes
  of Jutland.</p>

  <p>Now if we suppose that the real Angles of Germany were either so
  reduced in numbers as to have become an obscure tribe, or so incorporated
  with other populations as to have lost their independent existence, we
  can easily see how the similarity of name, combined with the geographical
  contiguity of Anglen to the Saxon frontier, might mislead even so good a
  writer as Beda, into the notion that he had found the country of the
  <i>Angles</i> in the <i>Angulus</i> (Anglen) of Sleswick.</p>

  <p>The true <i>Angles</i> were the descendants of the <i>Angli</i> of
  Tacitus. Who these were will be investigated in §§ <a
  href="#sect47">47</a>-<a href="#sect54">54</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect16">§ 16</a>. <i>The Saxons of Beda.</i>&mdash;The Saxons
  of Beda reached from the country of the Old Saxons<a name="footnotetag29"
  href="#footnote29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> on the <!-- Page 13 --><span

  that of the Nordalbingian<a name="footnotetag30"
  href="#footnote30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> Saxons between the Elbe and Eyder;
  and nearly, but not quite, coincided with the present countries of
  Hanover, Oldenburg, Westphalia, and part of Holstein. This we may call
  the <i>Saxon</i>, or (as reasons will be given for considering that it
  nearly coincided with the country of the Angles) the <i>Anglo-Saxon</i>
  area.</p>

  <p><a name="sect17">§ 17</a>. <i>River-system and sea-board of the
  Anglo-Saxon area.</i>&mdash;As the invasion of England took place by sea,
  we must expect to find in the invaders a maritime population. This leads
  to the consideration of the physical character of that part of Germany
  which they occupied. And here comes a remarkable and unexpected fact. The
  line of coast between the Rhine and Elbe, the line which in reasoning
  <i>a priori</i>, we should fix upon as the most likely tract for the bold
  seamen who wrested so large an island as Great Britain from its original
  occupants (changing it from <i>Britain</i> to <i>England</i>), to have
  proceeded from, is <i>not</i> the country of the Anglo-Saxons. On the
  contrary, it is the country of a similar but different section of the
  Germanic population, a section which has not received the attention from
  the English historian which it deserves. The country in question is the
  area of&mdash;</p>

  <p><a name="sect18">§ 18</a>. <i>The Frisians.</i>&mdash;At the present
  moment the language of the Dutch province of Friesland is materially
  different from that of the other parts of the kingdom of Holland. In
  other words it is not Dutch. Neither is it German&mdash;although, of
  course, it resembles both languages. On the other hand, it is more like
  the English than any other language or dialect in Germany is.</p>

  <p>It is a language of considerable antiquity, and <!-- Page 14 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>[14]</span>although at present it is
  spoken by the country-people only, it possesses a considerable
  literature. There is the <i>Middle</i> Frisian of Gysbert
  Japicx,<sup>[<a name="endnotetag17" href="#endnote17">17</a>]</sup> and
  the <i>Old</i> Frisian of the Frisian Laws.<sup>[<a name="endnotetag18"
  href="#endnote18">18</a>]</sup> The older the specimen of the Frisian
  language the more closely does it show its affinity to the English; hence
  the earliest Frisian and the Anglo-Saxon are exceedingly alike.
  Nevertheless they differ.</p>

  <p><a name="sect19">§ 19</a>. The Frisian was once spoken over a far
  greater area than at present. It was the original language of almost all
  Holland. It was the language of East Friesland to a late period. It was,
  probably, the language of the ancient Chauci. At the present time
  (besides Friesland) it survives in Heligoland, in the islands between the
  Ems and Weser, in part of Sleswick, and in a few localities in Oldenburg
  and Westphalia.</p>

  <p>Hence it is probable that the original Frisian, extending to an
  uncertain and irregular distance inland, lay between the Saxons and the
  sea, and stretched from the Zuyder Zee to the Elbe; a fact which would
  leave to the latter nation the lower Elbe and the Weser as their
  water-system: the extent to which they were in direct contact with the
  ocean being less than we are prepared to expect from their subsequent
  history.</p>

  <p>On the other hand the <i>a priori</i> probabilities of there being
  Frisians as well as Anglo-Saxons amongst the conquerors of Great Britain
  are considerable.&mdash;See §§ <a href="#sect55">55</a>, <a
  href="#sect56">56</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect20">§ 20</a>. The Anglo-Saxon area coincided&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. <i>Politically.</i>&mdash;With the kingdom of Hanover, the duchy of
  Oldenburg, and parts of Westphalia and Holstein.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Physically.</i>&mdash;With the basin of the Weser.</p>

  <p>It was <i>certainly</i> from the Anglo-Saxon, and <i>probably</i> <!--
  Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>[15]</span>from a
  part of the Frisian area that Great Britain was first invaded.</p>

  <p>This is as much as it is safe to say at present. The preceding chapter
  investigated the <i>date</i> of the Germanic migration into Britain; the
  present has determined the <i>area</i> from which it went forth.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">OF THE DIALECTS OF THE SAXON AREA, AND OF THE SO-CALLED OLD SAXON.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect21">§ 21</a>. The area occupied by the Saxons of Germany
  has been investigated; and it now remains to ask, how far the language of
  the occupants was absolutely identical throughout, or how far it fell
  into dialects or sub-dialects.</p>

  <p>There were at least <i>two</i> divisions of the Saxon; (1st) the Saxon
  of which the extant specimens are of English origin, and (2nd), the Saxon
  of which the extant specimens are of Continental origin. We will call
  these at present the Saxon of England, and the Saxon of the
  Continent.</p>

  <p><a name="sect22">§ 22</a>. Respecting the Saxon of England and the
  Saxon of the Continent, there is good reason for believing that the
  <i>first</i> was spoken in the <i>northern</i>, the <i>second</i> in the
  <i>southern</i> portion of the Saxon area, <i>i.e.</i>, the one in
  Hanover and the other in Westphalia, the probable boundaries between them
  being the line of highlands between Osnaburg and Paderborn.</p>

  <p><a name="sect23">§ 23</a>. Respecting the Saxon of England and the
  Saxon of the Continent, there is good reason for believing that, whilst
  the <i>former</i> was the mother-tongue of the Angles and the conquerors
  of England, the <i>latter</i> was that of the Cherusci of Arminius, the
  conquerors and the annihilators of the legions of Varus.<sup>[<a

  <p><a name="sect24">§ 24</a>. Respecting the Saxon of England and the
  <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>[17]</span>Saxon of the Continent, it is a fact that,
  whilst we have a full literature in the former, we have but fragmentary
  specimens of the latter&mdash;these being chiefly the following: (1) the

  Hildubrand and Hathubrant,<sup>[<a name="endnotetag21"

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">AFFINITIES OF THE ENGLISH WITH THE LANGUAGES OF GERMANY AND SCANDINAVIA.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect30">§ 30</a>. Over and above those languages of Germany
  and Holland which were akin to the dialects of the Anglo-Saxons, cognate
  languages were spoken in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and the Feroe
  isles, <i>i.e.</i>, in Scandinavia.</p>

  <p><a name="sect31">§ 31</a>. The general collective designation for the
  Germanic tongues of Germany and Holland, and for the Scandinavian
  languages of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and the Feroe Isles, is
  taken from the name of those German tribes who, during the decline of the
  Roman Empire, were best known to the Romans as the <i>Goths</i>; the term
  <i>Gothic</i> for the Scandinavian and Germanic languages, collectively,
  being both current and convenient.</p>

  <p><a name="sect32">§ 32</a>. Of this great <i>stock</i> of languages the
  Scandinavian is one <i>branch</i>; the Germanic, called also Teutonic,
  another.</p>

  <p><a name="sect33">§ 33</a>. The Scandinavian branch of the Gothic stock
  comprehends, 1. The dialects of Scandinavia Proper, <i>i.e.</i>, of
  Norway and Sweden; 2. of the Danish isles and Jutland; 3. of Iceland; 4.
  of the Feroe Isles.</p>

  <p><a name="sect34">§ 34</a>. The Teutonic branch falls into three
  divisions:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. The M&oelig;so-Gothic.</p>
      <p>2. The High Germanic.</p>
<!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>[19]</span>
      <p>3. The Low Germanic.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><a name="sect35">§ 35</a>. It is in the M&oelig;so-Gothic that the
  most ancient specimen of any Gothic tongue has been preserved. It is also
  the M&oelig;so-Gothic that was spoken by the conquerors of ancient Rome;
  by the subjects of Hermanric, Alaric, Theodoric, Euric, Athanaric, and
  Totila.</p>

  <p>In the reign of Valens, when pressed by intestine wars, and by the
  movements of the Huns, the Goths were assisted by that emperor, and
  settled in the Roman province of M&oelig;sia.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, they were converted to Christianity; and the Bible was
  translated into their language by their Bishop Ulphilas.</p>

  <p>Fragments of this translation, chiefly from the Gospels, have come
  down to the present time; and the Bible translation of the Arian Bishop
  Ulphilas, in the language of the Goths of M&oelig;sia, during the reign
  of Valens, exhibits the earliest sample of any Gothic tongue.</p>

  <p><a name="sect36">§ 36</a>. The Old High German, called also
  Francic<sup>[<a name="endnotetag24" href="#endnote24">24</a>]</sup> and
  Alemannic,<sup>[<a name="endnotetag25" href="#endnote25">25</a>]</sup>
  was spoken in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries, in Suabia,
  Bavaria, and Franconia.</p>

  <p>The Middle High German ranges from the thirteenth century to the
  Reformation.</p>

  <p><a name="sect37">§ 37</a>. The low Germanic division, to which the
  Anglo-Saxon belongs, is currently said to comprise six languages, or
  rather four languages in different stages.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I. II.&mdash;The Anglo-Saxon and Modern English.</p>
      <p>III. The Old Saxon.</p>
      <p>IV. V.&mdash;The Old Frisian and Modern Dutch.</p>
      <p>VI.&mdash;The Platt-Deutsch, or Low German.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><a name="sect38">§ 38</a>. <i>The Frisian and Dutch.</i>&mdash;It is a
  current statement that the Old Frisian bears the same relation to the
  Modern Dutch of Holland that the Anglo-Saxon does to the English. <!--
  Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>[20]</span></p>

  <p>The truer view of the question is as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. That a single language, spoken in two dialects, was originally
  common to both Holland and Friesland.</p>

  <p>2. That from the northern of these dialects we have the Modern Frisian
  of Friesland.</p>

  <p>3. From the southern, the Modern Dutch of Holland.</p>

  <p>The reason of this refinement is as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The Modern Dutch has certain grammatical forms <i>older</i> than those
  of the old Frisian; <i>e.g.</i>, the Dutch infinitives and the Dutch weak
  substantives, in their oblique cases, end in <i>-en</i>; those of the Old
  Frisian in <i>-a</i>: the form in <i>-en</i> being the older.</p>

  <p>The true Frisian is spoken in few and isolated localities. There
  is&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The Frisian of the Dutch state called Friesland.</p>

  <p>2. The Frisian of the parish of Saterland, in Westphalia.</p>

  <p>3. The Frisian of Heligoland.</p>

  <p>4. The North Frisian, spoken in a few villages of Sleswick. One of the
  characters of the North Frisian is the possession of a dual number.</p>

  <p>In respect to its stages, we have the Old Frisian of the Asega-bog,
  the Middle Frisian of Gysbert Japicx,<a name="footnotetag31"
  href="#footnote31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> and the Modern Frisian of the
  present Frieslanders, Westphalians, and Heligolanders.</p>

  <p><a name="sect39">§ 39</a>. <i>The Low German and
  Platt-Deutsch.</i>&mdash;The words <i>Low-German</i> are not only lax in
  their application, but they are <i>equivocal</i>; since the term has two
  meanings, a <i>general</i> meaning when it signifies a division of the
  Germanic languages, comprising English, Dutch, Anglo-Saxon, Old Saxon,
  and Frisian, and a limited one when it means the particular dialects of
  the Ems, the Weser, and the Elbe. To avoid this the dialects in question
  <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>[21]</span>are
  conveniently called by their continental name of <i>Platt-Deutsch</i>,
  just as in England we say <i>Broad</i> Scotch.</p>

  <p><a name="sect40">§ 40</a>. The most characteristic difference between
  the Saxon and Icelandic (indeed between the Teutonic and Scandinavian
  tongues) lies in the peculiar position of the definite article in the
  latter. In Saxon, the article corresponding with the modern word
  <i>the</i>, is <i>þæt</i>, <i>se</i>, <i>seó</i>, for the neuter,
  masculine, and feminine genders respectively; and these words, regularly
  declined, are <i>prefixed</i> to the words with which they agree, just as
  is the case with the English and with the majority of languages. In
  Icelandic, however, the article instead of preceding, <i>follows</i> its
  noun, <i>with which it coalesces</i>, having previously suffered a change
  in form. The Icelandic article corresponding to <i>þæt</i>, <i>se</i>,
  <i>seó</i>, is <i>hitt</i>, <i>hinn</i>, <i>hin</i>: from this the
  <i>h</i> is ejected, so that, instead of the regular inflection
  (<i>a</i>), we have the forms (<i>b</i>).</p>

  <p>In the Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish this peculiarity in the position
  of the definite article is preserved. Its origin, however, is concealed;
  and an accidental identity with the indefinite article has led to false
  notions respecting its nature. In the languages in point the <i>i</i> is
  changed into <i>e</i>, so that what in Icelandic is <i>it</i> and
  <i>in</i>, is in Danish <i>et</i> and <i>en</i>. <i>En</i>, however, as a
  separate word, is the numeral <i>one</i>, and also the indefinite article
  <i>a</i>; whilst in the neuter gender it is <i>et</i>&mdash;en sol, <i>a
  sun</i>; et bord, <i>a table</i>: solon, <i>the sun</i>; bordet, <i>the
  table</i>. From modern forms like those just quoted, it has been imagined
  that the definite is merely the indefinite article transposed. This it is
  not.</p>

  <p>To apply an expression of Mr. Cobbet's, <i>en</i> = <i>a</i>, and
  <i>-en</i> = <i>the</i>, are <i>the same combination of letters, but not
  the same word</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect41">§ 41</a>. Another characteristic of the Scandinavian
  language is the possession of a <i>passive</i> form, or a <i>passive</i>
  voice, ending in <i>-st</i>:&mdash;<i>ek</i>, <i>þu</i>, <i>hann
  brennist</i> = <i>I am</i>, <i>thou art</i>, <i>he is burnt</i>; <i>ver
  brennumst</i> = <i>we are burnt</i>; <i>þér brennizt</i> = <i>ye are
  burnt</i>; <i>þeir brennast</i> = <i>they are burnt</i>. Past tense,
  <i>ek</i>, <i>þu</i>, <i>hann brendist</i>; <i>ver brendumst</i>, <i>þér
  brenduzt</i>, <i>þeir brendust</i>. Imperat.: <i>brenstu</i> = <i>be thou
  burnt</i>. Infinit.: <i>brennast</i> = <i>to be burnt</i>. <!-- Page 23
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>[23]</span></p>

  <p>In the modern Danish and Swedish, the passive is still preserved, but
  without the final <i>t</i>. In the <i>older</i> stages of Icelandic, on
  the other hand, the termination was not <i>-st</i> but <i>-sc</i>; which
  <i>-sc</i> grew out of the reflective pronoun <i>sik</i>. With these
  phenomena the Scandinavian languages give us the evolution and
  development of a passive voice; wherein we have the following series of
  changes:&mdash;1. the reflective pronoun coalesces with the verb, whilst
  the sense changes from that of a reflective to that of a middle verb; 2.
  the <i>c</i> changes to <i>t</i>, whilst the middle sense passes into a
  passive one; 3. <i>t</i> is dropped from the end of the word, and the
  expression that was once reflective then becomes strictly passive.</p>

  <p>Now the Saxons have no passive voice at all. That they should have one
  <i>originating</i> like that of the Scandinavians was impossible,
  inasmuch as they had no reflective pronoun, and, consequently, nothing to
  evolve it from.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ANALYSIS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</span>&mdash;<span class="scac">GERMANIC ELEMENTS.</span>&mdash;<span class="scac">THE ANGLES.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect42">§ 42</a>. The language of England has been formed out
  of three elements.</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> Elements referable to the original British population, and
  derived from times anterior to the Anglo-Saxon invasion.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, or imported elements.</p>

  <p><i>c.</i> Elements introduced since the Anglo-Saxon conquest.</p>

  <p><a name="sect43">§ 43</a>. Each of these requires a special analysis,
  but that of the second will be taken first, and form the contents of the
  present chapter.</p>

  <p>All that we have at present learned concerning the Germanic invaders
  of England, is the geographical area which they originally occupied. How
  far, however, it was simple Saxons who conquered England single-handed,
  or how far the particular Saxon Germans were portions of a complex
  population, requires further investigation. Were the Saxons one division
  of the German population, whilst the Angles were another? or were the
  Angles a section of the Saxons, so that the latter was a generic term
  including the former? Again, although the Saxon invasion may be the one
  which has had the greatest influence, and drawn the most attention, why
  may there not have been separate and independent migrations, the <!--
  Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>[25]</span>effects
  and record of which have, in the lapse of time, become fused with those
  of the more important divisions?</p>

  <p><a name="sect44">§ 44</a>. <i>The Angles; who were they? and what was
  their relation to the Saxons?</i>&mdash;The first answer to this question
  embodies a great fact in the way of internal evidence, <i>viz.</i>, that
  they were the people from whom <i>England</i> derives the name it bears =
  <i>Angle land</i>, i.e., <i>land of the Angles</i>. Our language too is
  <i>English</i>, i.e., <i>Angle</i>. Whatever, then, they may have been on
  the Continent, they were a leading section of the invaders here. Why then
  has their position in our inquiries been hitherto so subordinate to that
  of the Saxons? It is because their importance and preponderance are not
  so manifest in Germany as we infer them to have been in Britain. Nay
  more, their historical place amongst the nations of Germany, is both
  insignificant and uncertain; indeed, it will be seen from the sequel,
  that <i>in and of themselves</i> we know next to nothing about them,
  knowing them only in their <i>relations</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, to ourselves
  and to the Saxons.</p>

  <p><a name="sect45">§ 45</a>. Although they are the section of the
  immigration which gave the name to England, and, as such, the
  preponderating element in the eyes of the present <i>English</i>, they
  were not so in the eyes of the original British; who neither knew at the
  time of the Conquest, nor know now, of any other name for their German
  enemies but <i>Saxon</i>. And <i>Saxon</i> is the name by which the
  present English are known to the Welsh, Armorican, and Gaelic Celts.</p>

  <p><a name="sect46">§ 46</a>. Although they are the section of the

  quite as little Angles as Saxons in the eyes of foreign <!-- Page 26

  writers; since the expression <i>Saxoniæ transmarinæ</i>, occurs as

  <p><i>Heading of a law referred to the age of Charlemagne.</i>&mdash;This
  connects them with the Werini (Varni) and the Thuringians&mdash;"Incipit
  lex <i>Angliorum</i> et <i>Werinorum</i> hoc est <i>Thuringorum</i>."</p>

  <p><a name="sect48">§ 48</a>. These notices agree in giving the Angles a
  <i>German</i> locality, and in connecting them ethnologically, and
  philologically with the <i>Germans</i> of Germany. And such was,
  undoubtedly, the case. Nevertheless, it may be seen from § <a
  href="#sect15">15</a> that a <i>Danish</i> origin has been assigned to
  them.</p>

  <p>The exact Germanic affinities of the Angles are, how ever, difficult
  to ascertain, since the tribes with which they are classed are
  differently classed. This we shall see by asking the following
  questions:&mdash;</p>

  <p><a name="sect49">§ 49</a>. What were the <i>Langobardi</i>, with whom
  the Angles were connected by Tacitus? The most important fact to be known
  concerning them is, that the general opinion is in favour of their having
  belonged to either the <i>High</i>-German, or M&oelig;so-Gothic division,
  rather than to the <i>Low</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect50">§ 50</a>. What were the <i>Suevi</i>, with whom the
  Angles were connected by Tacitus? The most important fact to be known
  concerning them is, that the general opinion is in favour of their having
  belonged to either the <i>High</i>-German or M&oelig;so-Gothic division
  rather than to the <i>Low</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect51">§ 51</a>. What were the <i>Werini</i>, with whom the
  Angles were connected in the <i>Leges Anglorum et Werinorum</i>? Without
  having any particular <i>data</i> for connecting the Werini (Varni, <span
  title="Ouarnoi" class="grk"
  >&Omicron;&#x1F50;&#x1F71;&rho;&nu;&omicron;&iota;</span>) with either
  the High-German, or <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>[28]</span>the M&oelig;so-Gothic divisions, there are
  certain facts in favour of their being <i>Slavonic</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect52">§ 52</a>. What were the <i>Thuringians</i>, with whom
  the Angles are connected in the <i>Leges Anglorum</i>? Germanic in
  locality, and most probably allied to the Goths of M&oelig;sia in
  language. If not, High-Germans.</p>

  <p><a name="sect53">§ 53</a>. Of the Reudigni, Eudoses, Nuithones,
  Suardones, and Aviones, too little is known in detail to make the details
  an inquiry of importance.</p>

  <p><a name="sect54">§ 54</a>. The reader has now got a general view of
  the extent to which the position of the Angles, as a German tribe, is
  complicated by conflicting statements; statements which connect them with
  (probably) <i>High</i>-German Thuringians, Suevi, and Langobardi, and
  with (probably) <i>Slavonic</i> Werini, or Varni; whereas in England,
  they are scarcely distinguishable from the <i>Low</i>-German Saxons. In
  the present state of our knowledge, the only safe fact seems to be, that
  of the common relation of both <i>Angles</i> and Saxons to the present
  <i>English</i> of England.</p>

  <p>This brings the two sections within a very close degree of affinity,
  and makes it probable, that, just as at present, descendants of the
  Saxons are English (<i>Angle</i>) in Britain, so, in the third and fourth
  centuries, ancestors of the Angles were Saxons in Germany. Why, however,
  the one name preponderated on the Continent, and the other in England is
  difficult to ascertain.</p>

  <p><a name="sect55">§ 55</a>. The Frisians have been mentioned as a
  Germanic population <i>likely</i> to have joined in the invasion of
  Britain; the <i>presumption</i> in favor of their having done so arising
  from their geographical position.</p>

  <p>There is, however, something more than mere presumption upon this
  point.</p>

  <p>Archbishop Usher, amongst the earlier historians, and <!-- Page 29
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>[29]</span>Mr. Kemble
  amongst those of the present day, as well as other intermediate
  investigators, have drawn attention to certain important notices of
  them.</p>

  <p>The main facts bearing upon this question are the
  following:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Hengist, according to some traditions, was a Frisian hero.</p>

  <p>3. In the Saxon Chronicle we find the following passage:&mdash;"That
  same year, the armies from among the East-Anglians, and from among the
  North-Humbrians, harassed the land of the West-Saxons chiefly, most of
  all by their 'æscs,' which they had built many years before. Then king
  Alfred commanded long ships to be built to oppose the æscs; they were
  full-nigh twice as long as the others; some had sixty oars, and some had
  more; they were both swifter and steadier, and also higher than the
  others. They were shapen neither like the <i>Frisian</i> nor the Danish,
  but so as it seemed to him that they would be most efficient. Then some
  time in the same year, there came six ships to Wight, and there did much
  harm, as well as in Devon, and elsewhere along the sea coast. Then the
  king commanded nine of the new ships to go thither, and they obstructed
  their passage from the port towards the outer sea. Then went they with
  three of their ships out against them; and three lay in the upper part of
  the port in the dry; the men were gone <!-- Page 30 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>[30]</span>from them ashore. Then
  took they two of the three ships at the outer part of the port, and
  killed the men, and the other ship escaped; in that also the men were
  killed except five; they got away because the other ships were aground.
  They also were aground very disadvantageously, three lay aground on that
  side of the deep on which the Danish ships were aground, and all the rest
  upon the other side, so that no one of them could get to the others. But
  when, the water had ebbed many furlongs from the ships, then the Danish
  men went from their three ships to the other three which were left by the
  tide on their side, and then they there fought against them. There was
  slain Lucumon the king's reeve, and Wulfheard the <i>Frisian</i>, and
  Æbbe the <i>Frisian</i>, and Æthelhere the <i>Frisian</i>, and Æthelferth
  the king's 'geneat,' and of all the men, <i>Frisians</i> and English,
  seventy-two; and of the Danish men one hundred and twenty."</p>

  <p><a name="sect56">§ 56</a>. I believe then, that, so far from the
  current accounts being absolutely correct, in respect to the Germanic
  elements of the English population, the <i>Jutes</i>, as mentioned by
  Beda, formed <i>no</i> part of it, whilst the <i>Frisians</i>, <i>not</i>
  so mentioned, <i>were a real constituent therein</i>; besides which,
  there may, very easily, have been other Germanic tribes, though in
  smaller proportions.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE CELTIC STOCK OF LANGUAGES, AND THEIR RELATIONS TO THE ENGLISH.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect57">§ 57</a>. The languages of Great Britain at the
  invasion of Julius Cæsar were of the Celtic stock.</p>

  <p>Of the Celtic stock there are two branches.</p>

  <p>1. The British or Cambrian branch, represented by the present Welsh,
  and containing, besides, the Cornish of Cornwall (lately extinct), and
  the Armorican of the French province of Brittany. It is almost certain
  that the old British, the ancient language of Gaul, and the Pictish were
  of this branch.</p>

  <p>2. The Gaelic or Erse branch, represented by the present Irish Gaelic,
  and containing, besides, the Gaelic of the Highlands of Scotland and the
  Manks of the Isle of Man.</p>

  <p><a name="sect58">§ 58</a>. Taken altogether the Celtic tongues form a
  very remarkable class. As compared with those of the Gothic stock they
  are marked by the following characteristics:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>The scantiness of the declension of Celtic nouns.</i>&mdash;In
  Irish there is a peculiar form for the dative plural, as <i>cos</i> =
  <i>foot</i>, <i>cos-aibh</i> = <i>to feet</i> (ped-<i>ibus</i>); and
  beyond this there is nothing else whatever in the way of <i>case</i>, as
  found in the German, Latin, Greek, and other tongues. Even the isolated
  form in question is not found in the <!-- Page 32 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>[32]</span>Welsh and Breton. Hence
  the Celtic tongues are pre-eminently uninflected in the way of
  <i>declension</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect59">§ 59</a>. The <i>agglutinate character of their
  verbal inflections</i>.&mdash;In Welsh the pronouns for <i>we</i>,
  <i>ye</i>, and <i>they</i>, are <i>ni</i>, <i>chwyi</i>, and <i>hwynt</i>
  <i>respectively</i>. In Welsh also the root = <i>love</i> is <i>car</i>.
  As conjugated in the plural number this is&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>car-<i>wn</i> = am-<i>amus</i>.</p>
      <p>car-<i>ych</i> = am-<i>atis</i>.</p>
      <p>car-<i>ant</i> = am-<i>ant</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now the <i>-wn</i>, <i>-ych</i>, and <i>-ant</i>, of the persons of
  the verbs are the personal pronouns, so that the inflection is really a
  verb and a pronoun in a state of <i>agglutination</i>; <i>i.e.</i>, in a
  state where the original separate existence of the two sorts of words is
  still manifest. This is probably the case with languages in general. The
  Celtic, however, has the peculiarity of exhibiting it in an unmistakable
  manner; showing, as it were, an inflection in the process of formation,
  and (as such) exhibiting an early stage of language.</p>

  <p><a name="sect60">§ 60</a>. <i>The system of initial
  mutations.</i>&mdash;The Celtic, as has been seen, is deficient in the
  ordinary means of expressing case. How does it make up for this? Even
  thus. The noun changes its initial letter according to its relation to
  the other words of the sentence. Of course this is subject to rule. As,
  however, I am only writing for the sake of illustrating in a general way
  the peculiarities of the Celtic tongues, the following table, from
  Prichard's "Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations," is sufficient.</p>

  <p><a name="sect61">§ 61</a>. The Celtic tongues have lately received
  especial illustration from the researches of Mr. Garnett. Amongst others,
  the two following points are particularly investigated by him:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The affinities of the ancient language of Gaul.</p>

  <p>2. The affinities of the Pictish language or dialect.</p>

  <p><a name="sect62">§ 62</a>. <i>The ancient language of Gaul
  Cambrian.</i>&mdash;The evidence in favour of the ancient language of
  Gaul being Cambrian rather than Gaelic, lies in the following
  facts:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The old Gallic glosses are more Welsh than Gaelic.</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> <i>Petorritum</i> = <i>a four-wheeled carriage</i>, from the
  Welsh, <i>peder</i> = <i>four</i>, and <i>rhod</i> = <i>a wheel</i>. The
  Gaelic <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34"></a>[34]</span>for <i>four</i> is <i>ceathair</i>, and the
  Gaelic compound would have been different.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> <i>Pempedula</i>, the <i>cinque-foil</i>, from the Welsh
  <i>pump</i> = <i>five</i>, and <i>dalen</i> = <i>a leaf</i>. The Gaelic
  for <i>five</i> is <i>cuig</i>, and the Gaelic compound would have been
  different.</p>

  <p><i>c.</i> <i>Candetum</i> = a measure of 100 feet, from the Welsh
  <i>cant</i> = 100. The Gaelic for <i>a hundred</i> is <i>cead</i>, and
  the Gaelic compound would have been different.</p>

  <p><i>d.</i> <i>Epona</i> = <i>the goddess of horses.</i> In the old
  Armorican the root <i>ep</i> = <i>horse</i>. The Gaelic for a horse is
  <i>each</i>.</p>

  <p><i>e.</i> The evidence from the names of geographical localities in
  Gaul, both ancient and modern, goes the same way: <i>Nantuates</i>,
  <i>Nantouin</i>, <i>Nanteuil</i>, are derived from the Welsh <i>nant</i>
  = <i>a valley</i>, a word unknown in Gaelic.</p>

  <p><i>f.</i> The evidence of certain French provincial words, which are
  Welsh and Armorican rather than Erse or Gaelic.</p>

  <p><a name="sect63">§ 63</a>. <i>The Pictish most probably
  Cambrian.</i>&mdash;The evidence in favour of the Pictish being Cambrian
  rather than Gaelic lies in the following facts:</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> When St. Columbanus preached, whose mother-tongue was Irish
  Gaelic, he used an interpreter. This shows the <i>difference</i> between
  the Pict and Gaelic. What follows shows the affinity between the Pict and
  Welsh.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> A manuscript in the Colbertine library contains a list of
  Pictish kings from the fifth century downwards. These names are more
  Welsh than Gaelic. <i>Taran</i> = <i>thunder</i> in Welsh. <i>Uven</i> is
  the Welsh <i>Owen</i>. The first syllable in <i>Talorg</i> ( =
  <i>forehead</i>) is the <i>tal</i> in <i>Talhaiarn</i> = <i>iron
  forehead</i>, <i>Taliessin</i> = <i>splendid forehead</i>, Welsh names.
  <i>Wrgust</i> is nearer to the Welsh <i>Gwrgust</i> than to the Irish
  <i>Fergus</i>. Finally, <i>Drust</i>, <i>Drostan</i>, <i>Wrad</i>,
  <i>Necton</i>, closely resemble the Welsh <i>Trwst</i>, <!-- Page 35
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>[35]</span><i>Trwstan</i>,
  <i>Gwriad</i>, <i>Nwython</i>. <i>Cineod</i> and <i>Domhnall</i>
  (<i>Kenneth</i> and <i>Donnell</i>) are the only true Erse forms in the
  list.</p>

  <p><i>c.</i> The only Pictish common name extant is the well-known
  compound <i>pen val</i>, which is, in the oldest MS. of Beda, <i>peann
  fahel</i>. This means <i>caput valli</i>, and is the name for the eastern
  termination of the Vallum of Antoninus. Herein <i>pen</i> is
  unequivocally Welsh, meaning <i>head</i>. It is an impossible form in
  Gaelic. <i>Fal</i>, on the other hand, is apparently Gaelic, the Welsh
  for a <i>rampart</i> being <i>gwall</i>. <i>Fal</i>, however, occurs in
  Welsh also, and means <i>inclosure</i>.</p>

  <p>The evidence just indicated is rendered nearly conclusive by an
  interpolation, apparently of the twelfth century, of the Durham MS. of
  Nennius, whereby it is stated that the spot in question was called in
  Gaelic <i>Cenail</i>. Now Cenail is the modern name <i>Kinneil</i>, and
  it is also a Gaelic translation of the Pict <i>pen val</i>, since
  <i>cean</i> is the Gaelic for <i>head</i>, and <i>fhail</i> for
  <i>rampart</i> or <i>wall</i>. If the older form were Gaelic, the
  substitution, or translation, would have been superfluous.</p>

  <p><i>d.</i> The name of the <i>Ochil Hills</i> in Perthshire is better
  explained from the Pict <i>uchel</i> = <i>high</i>, than from the Gaelic
  <i>uasal</i>.</p>

  <p><i>e.</i> Bryneich, the British form of the province Bernicia, is
  better explained by the Welsh <i>bryn</i> = <i>ridge</i> (<i>hilly
  country</i>), than by any word in Gaelic.&mdash;Garnett, in "Transactions
  of Philological Society."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE ANGLO-NORMAN, AND THE LANGUAGES OF THE CLASSICAL STOCK.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect64">§ 64</a>. The languages of Greece and Rome belong to
  one and the same stock.</p>

  <p>The Greek and its dialects, both ancient and modern, constitute the
  Greek of the Classical stock.</p>

  <p>The Latin in all its dialects, the old Italian languages allied to it,
  and the modern tongues derived from the Roman, constitute the Latin
  branch of the Classical stock.</p>

  <p>Now, although the Greek dialects are of only secondary importance in
  the illustration of the history of the English language, the Latin
  elements require a special consideration.</p>

  <p>This is because the Norman French, introduced into England by the
  battle of Hastings, is a language derived from the Roman, and
  consequently a language of the Latin branch of the Classical stock.</p>

  <p><a name="sect65">§ 65</a>. The Latin language overspread the greater
  part of the Roman empire. It supplanted a multiplicity of aboriginal
  languages; just as the English of North America <i>has</i> supplanted the
  aboriginal tongues of the native Indians, and just as the Russian
  <i>is</i> supplanting those of Siberia and Kamskatka.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the war that the Romans carried on against the old
  inhabitants was a war of extermination. In this case the original
  language was superseded <i>at once</i>. In <!-- Page 37 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>[37]</span>other cases their
  influence was introduced gradually. In this case the influence of the
  original language was greater and more permanent.</p>

  <p>Just as in the United States the English came in contact with an
  American, whilst in New Holland it comes in contact with an Australian
  language, so was the Latin language of Rome engrafted, sometimes on a
  Celtic, sometimes on a Gothic, and sometimes on some other stock. The
  nature of the original language must always be borne in mind.</p>

  <p>From Italy, its original seat, the Latin was extended in the following
  chronological order:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. To the Spanish Peninsula; where it overlaid or was engrafted on
  languages allied to the present Biscayan.</p>

  <p>2. To Gaul, or France, where it overlaid or was engrafted on languages
  of the Celtic stock.</p>

  <p>3. To Dacia and Pannonia where it overlaid or was engrafted on a
  language the stock whereof is undetermined, but which was, probably,
  Sarmatian. The introduction of the Latin into Dacia and Pannonia took
  place in the time of Trajan.</p>

  <p><a name="sect66">§ 66</a>. From these different introductions of the
  Latin into different countries we have the following modern
  languages&mdash;1st Italian, 2nd Spanish and Portuguese, 3rd French, 4th
  Wallachian; to which must be added a 5th, the Romanese of part of
  Switzerland.</p>

  <p>The French requires to be more minutely exhibited.</p>

  <p>Between the provincial French of the north and the provincial French

  <p>Practically speaking, although in the central parts of France the
  northern and southern dialects melt into each <!-- Page 40 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>[40]</span>other, the Loire may be
  considered as a line of demarcation between two languages; the term
  language being employed because, in the Middle Ages, whatever may be
  their real difference, their northern tongue and the southern tongue were
  dealt with not as separate dialects, but as distinct languages&mdash;the
  southern being called Provençal, the northern Norman-French.</p>

  <p>Of these two languages (for so they will in the following pages be
  called, for the sake of convenience) the southern, or Provençal,
  approaches the dialects of Spain; the Valencian of Spain and the
  Catalonian of Spain being Provençal rather than standard Spanish or
  Castilian.</p>

  <p>The southern French is sometimes called the Langue d'Oc, and sometimes
  the Limousin.</p>

  <p><a name="sect68">§ 68</a>. The Norman-French, spoken from the Loire to
  the confines of Flanders, and called also the Langue d'Oyl, differed from
  the Provençal in (amongst others) the following circumstances.</p>

  <p>1. It was of later origin; the southern parts of Gaul having been
  colonized at an early period by the Romans.</p>

  <p>2. It was in geographical contact, not with the allied languages of
  Spain, but with the Gothic tongues of Germany and Holland.</p>

  <p><a name="sect69">§ 69</a>. It is the Norman-French that most
  especially bears upon the history of the English language.</p>

  <p>In the northern French we must recognise not only a Celtic and a
  Classical, but also a Gothic element: since Clovis and Charlemagne were
  no Frenchmen, but Germans. The Germanic element in French has still to be
  determined.</p>

  <p>In the northern French of <i>Normandy</i> there is a second Gothic
  element, <i>viz.</i>, a Scandinavian element. See § <a

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">HISTORICAL AND LOGICAL ELEMENTS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect70">§ 70</a>. The Celtic elements of the present English
  fall into five classes.</p>

  <p>1. Those that are of late introduction, and cannot be called original
  and constituent parts of the language. Some of such are the words
  <i>flannel</i>, <i>crowd</i> (a fiddle), from the Cambrian; and
  <i>kerne</i> (an Irish foot-soldier), <i>galore</i> (enough),
  <i>tartan</i>, <i>plaid</i>, &amp;c., from the Gaelic branch.</p>

  <p>2. Those that are originally common to both the Celtic and Gothic
  stocks. Some of such are <i>brother</i>, <i>mother</i>, in Celtic
  <i>brathair</i>, <i>mathair</i>; the numerals, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>3. Those that have come to us from the Celtic, but have come to us
  through the medium of another language. Some of such are <i>druid</i> and
  <i>bard</i>, whose <i>immediate</i> source is, not the Celtic but the
  Latin.</p>

  <p>4. Celtic elements of the Anglo-Norman, introduced into England after
  the Conquest, and occurring in that language as remains of the original
  Celtic of Gaul. <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>[46]</span></p>

  <p>5. Those that have been retained from the original Celtic of the
  island, and which form genuine constituents of our language. These fall
  into three subdivisions.</p>

  <p><i>a</i>. Proper names&mdash;generally of geographical localities; as
  <i>the Thames</i>, <i>Kent</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>b</i>. Common names retained in the provincial dialects of England,
  but not retained in the current language; as <i>gwethall</i> =
  <i>household stuff</i>, and <i>gwlanen</i> = <i>flannel</i> in
  Herefordshire.</p>

  <p><i>c</i>. Common names retained in the current language.&mdash;The

  <p><a name="sect71">§ 71</a>. <i>Latin of the first period.</i>&mdash;Of
  the Latin introduced by Cæsar and his successors, the few words <!-- Page
  47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>[47]</span>remaining are
  those that relate to military affairs; <i>viz.</i> <i>street</i>
  (<i>strata</i>); <i>-coln</i> (as in <i>Lincoln</i> = <i>Lindi
  colonia</i>); <i>-cest-</i> (as in <i>Gloucester</i> = <i>glevæ
  castra</i>) from <i>castra</i>. The Latin words introduced between the
  time of Cæsar and Hengist may be called the <i>Latin of the first
  period</i>, or the <i>Latin of the Celtic period</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect72">§ 72</a>. <i>The Anglo-Saxon.</i>&mdash;This is not
  noticed here, because, from being the staple of the present language, it
  is more or less the subject of the book throughout.</p>

  <p><a name="sect73">§ 73</a>. <i>The Danish, or Norse.</i>&mdash;The
  pirates that pillaged Britain, under the name of Danes, were not
  exclusively the inhabitants of Denmark. Of the three Scandinavian
  nations, the Swedes took the least share, the Norwegians the greatest, in
  these invasions.</p>

  <p>The language of the three nations was the same; the differences being
  differences of dialect. It was that which is now spoken in Iceland,
  having been once common to Scandinavia and Denmark.</p>

  <p>The Danish that became incorporated with our language, under the reign
  of Canute and his sons, may be called the <i>direct</i> Danish element,
  in contradistinction to the <i>indirect</i> Danish of § <a
  href="#sect76">76</a>.</p>

  <p>The determination of the amount of Danish in English is difficult. It
  is not difficult to prove a word <i>Scandinavian</i>; but, then, we must
  also show that it is not German as well. A few years back the current
  opinion was against the doctrine that there was much Danish in England.
  At present, the tendency is rather the other way. The following facts are
  from Mr. Garnett.&mdash;"Phil. Trans." vol. i.</p>

  <p>1. The Saxon name of the present town of <i>Whitby</i> in Yorkshire
  was <i>Streoneshalch</i>. The present name <i>Whitby</i>, <i>Hvitby</i>,
  or <i>Whitetown</i>, is Danish. <!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page48"></a>[48]</span></p>

  <p>2. The Saxon name of the capital of Derbyshire was
  <i>Northweortheg</i>. The present name is Danish.</p>

  <p>3. The termination <i>-by</i> = <i>town</i> is Norse.</p>

  <p>4. On a monument in Aldburgh church, Holdernesse, in the East Riding
  of Yorkshire, referred to the age of Edward the Confessor, is found the
  following inscription:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Ulf</i> het aræran cyrice <i>for hanum</i> and for Gunthara saula.</p>
      <p class="hg3">"Ulf bid rear the church for him and for the soul of Gunthar."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now, in this inscription, <i>Ulf</i>, in opposition to the Anglo-Saxon
  <i>Wulf</i>, is a Norse form; whilst <i>hanum</i> is a Norse dative, and
  by no means an Anglo-Saxon one.&mdash;Old Norse <i>hanum</i>, Swedish
  <i>honom</i>.</p>

  <p>5. The use of <i>at</i> for <i>to</i> as the sign of the infinitive
  mood is Norse, not Saxon. It is the regular prefix in Icelandic, Danish,
  Swedish, and Feroic. It is also found in the northern dialects of the Old
  English, and in the particular dialect of Westmoreland at the present
  day.</p>

  <p>6. The use of <i>sum</i> for <i>as</i>; <i>e.g.</i>,&mdash;<i>swa
  sum</i> we forgive oure detturs.</p>

  <p>7. Isolated words in the northern dialects are Norse rather than
  Saxon.</p>

  <p><a name="sect74">§ 74</a>. <i>Roman of the second period.</i>&mdash;Of
  the Latin introduced under the Christianised Saxon sovereigns, many words
  are extant. <span class="correction" title="Original reads `The'."
  >They</span> relate chiefly to ecclesiastical matters, just as the Latin
  of the Celtic period bore upon military affairs. <i>Mynster</i>, a
  minster, <i>monasterium</i>; <i>portic</i>, a porch, <i>porticus</i>;
  <i>cluster</i>, a cloister, <i>claustrum</i>; <i>munuc</i>, a monk,
  <i>monachus</i>; <i>bisceop</i>, a bishop, <i>episcopus</i>;
  <i>arcebisceop</i>, archbishop, <i>archiepiscopus</i>; <i>sanct</i>, a

  psalter, <i>psalterium</i>; <i>mæsse</i>, a mass, <i>missa</i>;
  <i>pistel</i>, an epistle, <i>epistola</i>; <i>prædic-ian</i>, to preach,
  <i>prædicare</i>; <i>prof-ian</i>, to prove, <i>probare</i>.</p>

  <p>The following are the names of foreign plants and

  <i>feferfuge</i>, feverfew, <i>febrifuga</i>; <i>peterselige</i>,

  pepper, <i>piper</i>; <i>purpur</i>, purple, <i>purpura</i>;
  <i>pumicstan</i>, pumicestone, <i>pumex</i>.</p>

  <p>This is the Latin of the second, or Saxon period.</p>

  <p><a name="sect75">§ 75</a>. <i>The Anglo-Norman element.</i>&mdash;For
  practical purposes we may say that the French or Anglo-Norman element
  appeared in our language after the battle of Hastings, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1066.</p>

  <p>Previous, however, to that period we find notices of intercourse
  between the two countries.</p>

  <p>1. The residence in England of Louis Outremer.</p>

  <p>2. Ethelred II. married Emma, daughter of Richard Duke of Normandy,
  and the two children were sent to Normandy for education.</p>

  <p>3. Edward the Confessor is particularly stated to have encouraged
  French manners and the French language in England. <!-- Page 50 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>[50]</span></p>

  <p>4. Ingulphus of Croydon speaks of his own knowledge of French.</p>

  <p>5. Harold passed some time in Normandy.</p>

  <p>6. The French article <i>la</i>, in the term <i>la Drove</i>, occurs
  in a deed of <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 975.</p>

  <p>The chief Anglo-Norman elements of our language are the terms
  connected with the feudal system, the terms relating to war and chivalry,
  and a great portion of the law terms&mdash;<i>duke</i>, <i>count</i>,
  <i>baron</i>, <i>villain</i>, <i>service</i>, <i>chivalry</i>,
  <i>warrant</i>, <i>esquire</i>, <i>challenge</i>, <i>domain</i>,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><a name="sect76">§ 76</a>. When we remember that the word
  <i>Norman</i> means <i>man of the north</i>, that it is a
  <i>Scandinavian</i>, and <i>not a French</i> word, that it originated in
  the invasions of the followers of Rollo and and other <i>Norwegians</i>,
  and that just as part of England was overrun by Pagan buccaneers called
  <i>Danes</i>, part of France was occupied by similar <i>Northmen</i>, we
  see the likelihood of certain Norse words finding their way into the
  French language, where they would be superadded to its original Celtic
  and Roman elements.</p>

  <p>The extent to which this is actually the case has only been partially
  investigated. It is certain, however, that some French words are Norse or
  Scandinavian. Such, for instance, are several <i>names of geographical
  localities</i> either near the sea, or the river Seine, in other words,
  within that tract which was most especially occupied by the invaders. As
  is to be expected from the genius of the French language, these words are
  considerably altered in form. Thus,</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="French words which are Norse." title="French words which are Norse.">

<p><!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>[51]</span></p>

  <p>and in these shapes they appear in the Norman names <i>Yvetot</i>,
  <i>Caudebec</i>, and <i>Harfleur</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Now any words thus introduced from the Norse of Scandinavia into the
  French of Normandy, might, by the Norman Conquest of England, be carried
  further, and so find their way into the English.</p>

  <p>In such a case, they would constitute its <i>indirect</i> Scandinavian
  element.</p>

  <p>A list of these words has not been made; indeed the question requires
  far more investigation than it has met with. The names, however, of the
  islands <i>Guerns-ey</i>, <i>Jers-ey</i>, and <i>Aldern-ey</i>, are
  certainly of the kind in question&mdash;since the <i>-ey</i>, meaning
  <i>island</i>, is the same as the <i>-ey</i> in <i>Orkn-ey</i>, and is
  the Norse rather than the Saxon form.</p>

  <p><a name="sect77">§ 77</a>. <i>Latin of the third
  period.</i>&mdash;This means the Latin which was introduced between the
  battle of Hastings and the revival of literature. It chiefly originated
  in the cloister, in the universities, and, to a certain extent, in the
  courts of law. It must be distinguished from the <i>indirect</i> Latin
  introduced as part and parcel of the Anglo-Norman. It has yet to be
  accurately analyzed.</p>

  <p><a name="sect78">§ 78</a>. <i>Latin of the fourth
  period.</i>&mdash;This means the Latin which has been introduced between
  the revival of literature and the present time. It has originated in the
  writings of learned men in general, and is distinguished from that of the
  previous periods by:</p>

  <p>1. Being less altered in form:</p>

  <p>2. Preserving, with substantives, in many cases its original
  inflections; <i>axis</i>, <i>axes</i>; <i>basis</i>, <i>bases</i>:</p>

  <p>3. Relating to objects and ideas for which the increase of the range
  of science in general has required a nomenclature. <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>[52]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect79">§ 79</a>. <i>Greek.</i>&mdash;Words derived
  <i>directly</i> from the Greek are in the same predicament as the Latin
  of the third period&mdash;<i>phænomenon</i>, <i>phænomena</i>;
  <i>criterion</i>, <i>criteria</i>, &amp;c.; words which are only
  <i>indirectly</i> of Greek origin, being considered to belong to the
  language from which they were immediately introduced into the English.
  Such are <i>deacon</i>, <i>priest</i>, &amp;c., introduced through the
  Latin. Hence a word like <i>church</i> proves no more in regard to a
  Greek element in English, than the word <i>abbot</i> proves in respect to
  a Syrian one.</p>

  <p><a name="sect80">§ 80</a>. The Latin of the fourth period and the
  Greek agree in retaining, in many cases, original inflexions rather than
  adopting the English ones; in other words, they agree in being but
  <i>imperfectly incorporated</i>. The phænomenon of imperfect
  incorporation is reducible to the following rules:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. That it has a direct ratio to the date of the introduction,
  <i>i.e.</i>, the more recent the word the more likely it is to retain its
  original inflexion.</p>

  <p>2. That it has a relation to the number of meanings belonging to the
  words: thus, when a single word has two meanings, the original inflexion
  expresses one, the English inflexion another&mdash;<i>genius</i>,
  <i>genii</i>, often (<i>spirits</i>), <i>geniuses</i> (<i>men of
  genius</i>).</p>

  <p>3. That it occurs with substantives only, and that only in the
  expression of number. Thus, although the plural of substantives like
  <i>axis</i> and <i>genius</i> are Latin, the possessive cases are
  English. So also are the degrees of comparison for adjectives, like
  <i>circular</i>, and the tenses, &amp;c. for verbs, like
  <i>perambulate</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect81">§ 81</a>. The following is a list of the chief Latin
  substantives introduced during the latter part of the fourth period; and
  preserving the <i>Latin</i> plural forms&mdash; <!-- Page 53 --><span

  <p><a name="sect83">§ 83</a>. <i>Miscellaneous elements.</i>&mdash;Of
  miscellaneous elements we have two sorts; those that are incorporated in
  our language, and are currently understood (<i>e.g.</i>, the Spanish word
  <i>sherry</i>, the Arabic word <i>alkali</i>, and the Persian word
  <i>turban</i>), and those that, even amongst the educated, are considered
  strangers. Of this latter kind <!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page56"></a>[56]</span>(amongst many others) are the oriental words
  <i>hummum</i>, <i>kaftan</i>, <i>gul</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Of the currently understood miscellaneous elements of the English
  language, the most important are from the French; some of which agree
  with those of the Latin of the fourth period, and the Greek, in
  preserving the <i>French</i> plural forms&mdash;as <i>beau</i>,
  <i>beaux</i>, <i>billets-doux</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Italian.</i>&mdash;Some words of Italian origin do the same; as
  <i>virtuoso</i>, <i>virtuosi</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Hebrew.</i>&mdash;The Hebrew words, <i>cherub</i> and <i>seraph</i>
  do the same; the form <i>cherub-im</i>, and <i>seraph-im</i> being not
  only plurals but Hebrew plurals.</p>

  <p>Beyond the words derived from these five languages, none form their
  plural other than after the English method, <i>i.e.</i>, in <i>-s</i>, as
  <i>waltzes</i>, from the <i>German</i> word <i>waltz</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect84">§ 84</a>. Hence we have a measure of the extent to
  which a language, which, like the English, at one and the same time
  requires names for many objects, comes in contact with the tongues of
  half the world, and has moreover, a great power of incorporating foreign
  elements, derives fresh words from varied sources; as may be seen from
  the following incomplete notice of the languages which have, in different
  degrees, supplied it with new terms.</p>

  <p><i>Arabic.</i>&mdash;Admiral, alchemist, alchemy, alcohol, alcove,
  alembic, algebra, alkali, assassin.</p>

  <p><i>Persian.</i>&mdash;Turban, caravan, dervise, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Turkish.</i>&mdash;Coffee, bashaw, divan, scimitar, janisary,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Hindoo languages.</i>&mdash;Calico, chintz, cowrie, curry, lac,
  muslin, toddy, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Chinese.</i>&mdash;Tea, bohea, congou, hyson, soy, nankin &amp;c.
  <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page57"></a>[57]</span></p>

  <p><i>Malay.</i>&mdash;Bantam (fowl), gamboge, rattan, sago, shaddock,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Polynesian.</i>&mdash;Taboo, tattoo.</p>

  <p><i>Tungusian or some similar Siberian language.</i>&mdash;Mammoth, the
  bones of which are chiefly from the banks of the Lena.</p>

  <p><i>North American Indian.</i>&mdash;Squaw, wigwam, pemmican.</p>

  <p><i>Peruvian.</i>&mdash;Charki = prepared meat; whence <i>jerked</i>
  beef.</p>

  <p><i>Caribbean.</i>&mdash;Hammock.</p>

  <p><a name="sect85">§ 85</a>. A distinction is drawn between the
  <i>direct</i> and <i>indirect</i>, the latter leading to the <i>ultimate
  origin</i> of words.</p>

  <p>Thus a word borrowed into the English from the French, might have been
  borrowed into the French from the Latin, into the Latin from the Greek,
  into the Greek from the Persian, &amp;c., and so <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

  <p>The investigation of this is a matter of literary curiosity rather
  than any important branch of philology.</p>

  <p>The ultimate known origin of many common words sometimes goes back to
  a great date, and points to extinct languages&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Ancient Nubian.</i>&mdash;Barbarous.</p>

  <p><i>Ancient Egyptian.</i>&mdash;Ammonia.</p>

  <p><i>Ancient Syrian.</i>&mdash;Cyder.</p>

  <p><i>Ancient Lycian.</i>&mdash;Pandar.</p>

  <p><i>Ancient Lydian.</i>&mdash;Mæander.</p>

  <p><i>Ancient Persian.</i>&mdash;Paradise.</p>

  <p><a name="sect86">§ 86</a>. Again, a word from a given language may be
  introduced by more lines than one; or it may be introduced twice over;
  once at an earlier, and again at a later period. In such a case its form
  will, most probably, vary; and, what is more, its meaning as well. <!--
  Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>[58]</span>Words of
  this sort may be called <i>di-morphic</i>, their <i>dimorphism</i> having
  originated in one of two reasons&mdash;a difference of channel or a
  difference of date. Instances of the first are, <i>syrup</i>,
  <i>sherbet</i>, and <i>shrub</i>, all originally from the <i>Arabic</i>,
  <i>srb</i>; but introduced differently, viz., the first through the
  Latin, the second through the Persian, and the third through the Hindoo.
  Instances of the second are words like <i>minster</i>, introduced during
  the Anglo-Saxon, as contrasted with <i>monastery</i>, introduced during
  the Anglo-Norman period. By the proper application of these processes, we
  account for words so different in present form, yet so identical in
  origin, as <i>priest</i> and <i>presbyter</i>, <i>episcopal</i> and
  <i>bishop</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p><a name="sect87">§ 87</a>. <i>Distinction.</i>&mdash;The history of
  the languages that have been spoken in a particular country, is a
  different subject from the history of a particular language. The history
  of the languages that have been spoken in the United States of America,
  is the history of <i>Indian</i> languages. The history of the <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `languages' but the sense seems to need the singular, viz. American English."
  >language</span> of the United States is the history of a Germanic
  language.</p>

  <p><a name="sect88">§ 88</a>. <i>Words of foreign simulating a vernacular
  origin.</i>&mdash;These may occur in any mixed language whatever; they
  occur, however, oftener in the English than in any other.</p>

  <p>Let a word be introduced from a foreign language&mdash;let it have
  some resemblance in sound to a real English term: lastly, let the
  meanings of the two words be not absolutely incompatible. We may then
  have a word of foreign origin taking the appearance of an English one.
  Such, amongst others, are <i>beef-eater</i>, from
  <i>b&oelig;uffetier</i>; <i>sparrow-grass</i>, <i>asparagus</i>;

  <p><i>Dog-cheap</i>.&mdash;This has nothing to do with <i>dogs</i>. The
  first syllabic is <i>god</i> = <i>good</i> transposed, and the second the
  <i>ch-p</i> in <i>chapman</i> ( = <i>merchant</i>) <i>cheap</i>, and
  <i>Eastcheap</i>. In Sir J. Mandeville, we find <i>god-kepe</i> = <i>good
  bargain</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Sky-larking</i>.&mdash;Nothing to do with <i>larks</i> of any sort;
  still less the particular species, <i>alauda arvensis</i>. The word
  improperly spelt <i>l-a-r-k</i>, and banished to the slang regions of the
  English language, is the Anglo-Saxon <i>lác</i> = <i>game</i>, or
  <i>sport</i>; wherein the a is sounded as in <i>father</i> (not as in
  <i>farther</i>). <i>Lek</i> = <i>game</i>, in the present Scandinavian
  languages.</p>

  <p><i>Zachary Macaulay</i> = <i>Zumalacarregui</i>; <i>Billy Ruffian</i>
  = <i>Bellerophon</i>; <i>Sir Roger Dowlas</i> = <i>Surajah Dowlah</i>,
  although so limited to the common soldiers and sailors, who first used
  them, as to be exploded vulgarisms rather than integral parts of the
  language, are examples of the same tendency towards the irregular
  accommodation of misunderstood foreign terms.</p>

  <p><i>Birdbolt</i>.&mdash;An incorrect name for the <i>gadus lota</i>, or
  <span class="correction" title="Original reads `ell-pout'."
  ><i>eel-pout</i></span>, and a transformation of <i>barbote</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Whistle-fish</i>.&mdash;The same for <i>gadus mustela</i>, or
  <i>weasel-fish</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Liquorice</i> = <i>glycyrrhiza</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Wormwood</i> = <i>weremuth</i>, is an instance of a word from the
  same language, in an antiquated shape, being equally transformed with a
  word of really foreign origin.</p>

  <p><a name="sect89">§ 89</a>. Sometimes the transformation of the
  <i>name</i> has engendered a change in the object to which it applies,
  or, at least, has evolved new ideas in connection with it. How easy for a
  person who used the words <i>beef-eater</i>, <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>[60]</span><i>sparrow-grass</i>, or
  <i>Jerusalem</i>, to believe that the officers designated by the former
  either eat or used to eat more beef than any other people, that the
  second word was the name for a <i>grass</i> or herb of which
  <i>sparrows</i> were fond; and that <i>Jerusalem</i> artichokes came from
  Palestine.</p>

  <p>What has just been supposed has sometimes a real occurrence. To
  account for the name of <i>Shotover-hill</i>, I have heard that Little
  John <i>shot over</i> it. Here the confusion, in order to set itself
  right, breeds a fiction. Again, in chess, the piece now called the
  <i>queen</i>, was originally the <i>elephant</i>. This was in Persian,
  <i>ferz</i>. In French it became <i>vierge</i>, which, in time, came to
  be mistaken for a derivative, and <i>virgo</i> = <i>the virgin</i>,
  <i>the lady</i>, <i>the queen</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect90">§ 90</a>. Sometimes, where the form of a word in
  respect to its <i>sound</i> is not affected, a false spirit of
  accommodation introduces an unetymological <i>spelling</i>; as
  <i>frontisp</i>i<i>ece</i>, from <i>frontispecium</i>,
  <i>sover</i>e<i>ign</i>, from <i>sovrano</i>, <i>colle</i>a<i>gue</i>
  from <i>collega</i>, <i>lant</i>h<i>orn</i> (old orthography) from
  <i>lanterna</i>.</p>

  <p>The value of forms like these consists in their showing that language
  is affected by false etymologies as well as by true ones.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><a name="sect91">§ 91</a>. In <i>lambkin</i> and <i>lancet</i>, the
  final syllables (<i>-kin</i> and <i>-et</i>) have the same power. They
  both express the idea of smallness or diminutiveness. These words are but
  two out of a multitude, the one (<i>lamb</i>) being of Saxon, the other
  (<i>lance</i>) of Norman origin. The same is the case with the superadded
  syllables: <i>-kin</i> being Saxon; <i>-et</i> Norman. Now to add a Saxon
  termination to a Norman word, or <i>vice versâ</i>, is to corrupt the
  English language.</p>

  <p>This leads to some observation respecting the&mdash; <!-- Page 61

  <p><a name="sect92">§ 92</a>. <i>Introduction of new words and
  Hybridism.</i>&mdash;Hybridism is a term derived from <i>hybrid-a</i>,
  <i>a mongrel</i>; a Latin word <i>of Greek extraction</i>.</p>

  <p>The terminations <i>-ize</i> (as in <i>criticize</i>), <i>-ism</i> (as
  in <i>criticism</i>), <i>-ic</i> (as in <i>comic</i>)&mdash;these,
  amongst many others, are Greek terminations. To add them to words not of
  Greek origin is to be guilty of hybridism. Hence, <i>witticism</i> is
  objectionable.</p>

  <p>The terminations <i>-ble</i> (as in <i>penetrable</i>), <i>-bility</i>
  (as in <i>penetrability</i>), <i>-al</i> (as in
  <i>parental</i>)&mdash;these, amongst many others, are Latin
  terminations. To add them to words not of Latin origin is to be guilty of
  hybridism.</p>

  <p>Hybridism is the commonest fault that accompanies the introduction of
  new words. The hybrid additions to the English language are most numerous
  in works on science.</p>

  <p>It must not, however, be concealed that several well established words
  are hybrid; and that, even in the writings of the classical Roman
  authors, there is hybridism between the Latin and the Greek.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the etymological view of every word of foreign origin
  is, not that it is put together in England, but that it is brought whole
  from the language to which it is vernacular. Now no derived word can be
  brought whole from a language unless, in that language, all its parts
  exist. The word <i>penetrability</i> is not derived from the English word
  <i>penetrable</i>, by the addition of <i>-ty</i>. It is the Latin word
  <i>penetrabilitas</i> imported.</p>

  <p><i>In derived words all the parts must belong to one and the same
  language</i>, or, changing the expression, <i>every derived word must
  have a possible form in the language from which it is taken</i>. Such is
  the rule against hybridism.</p>

  name="page62"></a>[62]</span>a hybrid without really being so. The
  <i>-icle</i>, in <i>icicle</i>, is apparently the same as the
  <i>-icle</i> in <i>radicle</i>. Now, as <i>ice</i> is Gothic, and
  <i>-icle</i> classical, hybridism is simulated. <i>Icicle</i>, however,
  is not a derivative but a compound; its parts being <i>is</i> and
  <i>gicel</i>, both Anglo-Saxon words.<a name="footnotetag39"
  href="#footnote39"><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

  <p><a name="sect94">§ 94</a>. <i>On incompletion of the
  radical.</i>&mdash;Let there be in a given language a series of roots
  ending in <i>-t</i>, as <i>sæmat</i>. Let a euphonic influence eject the
  <i>-t</i>, as often as the word occurs in the nominative case. Let the
  nominative case be erroneously considered to represent the root, or
  radical, of the word. Let a derivative word be formed accordingly,
  <i>i.e.</i>, on the notion that the nominative form and the radical form
  coincide. Such a derivative will exhibit only a part of the root; in
  other words, the radical will be incomplete.</p>

  <p>Now all this is what actually takes place in words like
  <i>hæmo-ptysis</i> (<i>spitting of blood</i>), <i>sema-phore</i> (<i>a
  sort of telegraph</i>). The Greek imparisyllabics eject a part of the
  root in the nominative case; the radical forms being <i>hæmat-</i> and
  <i>sæmat-</i>, not <i>hæm-</i>and <i>sæm-</i>.</p>

  <p>Incompletion of the radical is one of the commonest causes of words
  being coined faultily. It must not, however, be concealed, that even in
  the classical writers, we have in words like <span title="distomos" class="grk"
  >&delta;&#x1F77;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  examples of incompletion of the radical.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><a name="sect95">§ 95</a>. The preceding chapters have paved the way
  for a distinction between the <i>historical</i> analysis of a language,
  and the <i>logical</i> analysis of one.</p>

  <p>Let the present language of England (for illustration's sake only)
  consist of 40,000 words. Of these let 30,000 <!-- Page 63 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>[63]</span>be Anglo-Saxon, 5,000
  Anglo-Norman, 100 Celtic, 10 Latin of the first, 20 Latin of the second,
  and 30 Latin of the third period, 50 Scandinavian, and the rest
  miscellaneous. In this case the language is considered according to the
  historical origin of the words that compose it, and the analysis is an
  historical analysis.</p>

  <p>But it is very evident that the English, or any other language, is
  capable of being contemplated in another view, and that the same number
  of words may be very differently classified. Instead of arranging them
  according to the languages whence they are derived, let them be disposed
  according to the meanings that they convey. Let it be said, for instance,
  that out of 40,000 words, 10,000 are the names of natural objects, that
  1000 denote abstract ideas, that 1000 relate to warfare, 1000 to church
  matters, 500 to points of chivalry, 1000 to agriculture, and so on
  through the whole. In this case the analysis is not historical but
  logical; the words being classed not according to their <i>origin</i>,
  but according to their <i>meaning</i>.</p>

  <p>Now the logical and historical analyses of a language generally in
  some degree coincide; that is, terms for a certain set of ideas come from
  certain languages; just as in English a large proportion of our chemical
  terms are Arabic, whilst a still larger one of our legal ones are
  Anglo-Norman.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE RELATION OF THE ENGLISH TO THE ANGLO-SAXON, AND THE STAGES OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect96">§ 96</a>. The relation of the present English to the
  Anglo-Saxon is that of a <i>modern</i> language to an <i>ancient</i> one:
  the words <i>modern</i> and <i>ancient</i> being used in a defined and
  technical sense.</p>

  <p>Let the word <i>smiðum</i> illustrate this. <i>Smið-um</i>, the dative
  plural of <i>smið</i>, is equivalent in meaning to the English <i>to
  smiths</i>; or to the Latin <i>fabr-is</i>. <i>Smiðum</i>, however, is a
  single Anglo-Saxon word (a substantive, and nothing more); whilst its
  English equivalent is two words (<i>i.e.</i>, a substantive with the
  addition of a preposition). The letter <i>s</i>, in <i>smiths</i>, shows
  that the word is plural. The <i>-um</i>, in <i>smiðum</i>, does this and
  something more. It is the sign of the <i>dative case</i> plural. The
  <i>-um</i> in <i>smiðum</i>, is the part of a word. The preposition
  <i>to</i> is a separate word with an independent existence. <i>Smiðum</i>
  is the radical syllable <i>smið</i> + the subordinate inflectional
  syllable <i>-um</i>, the sign of the dative case. The combination <i>to
  smiths</i> is the substantive <i>smiths</i> + the preposition <i>to</i>,
  equivalent in power to the sign of a dative case, but different from it
  in form. As far, then, as the words just quoted is concerned, the
  Anglo-Saxon differs from the English by expressing an idea by a certain
  <i>modification of the form of the root</i>, whereas the modern English
  denotes the same idea by <i>the addition of a preposition</i>; in <!--
  Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>[65]</span>other
  words, the Saxon <i>inflection</i> is superseded by a <i>combination</i>
  of words.</p>

  <p>The sentences in italics are mere variations of the same general
  statement. 1. <i>The earlier the stage of a given language the greater
  the amount of its inflectional forms, and the later the stage of a given
  language, the smaller the amount of them.</i> 2. <i>As languages become
  modern they substitute prepositions and auxiliary verbs for cases and
  tenses.</i> 3. <i>The amount of inflection is in the inverse proportion
  to the amount of prepositions and auxiliary verbs.</i> 4. <i>In the
  course of time languages drop their inflections, and substitute in its
  stead circumlocutions by means of prepositions, &amp;c. The reverse never
  takes place.</i> 5. <i>Given two modes of expression, the one
  inflectional</i> (smiðum), <i>the other circumlocutional</i><a
  name="footnotetag40" href="#footnote40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> (to smiths),
  <i>we can state that the first belongs to an early, the second to a late,
  state of language.</i></p>

  <p>The present chapter, then showing the relation of the English to the
  Anglo-Saxon, shows something more. It exhibits the <i>general</i>
  relation of a modern to an ancient language. As the English is to the
  Anglo-Saxon, so are the Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian, to the old Norse;
  and so are the French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanese and
  Wallachian to the Latin, and the Romaic to the ancient Greek.</p>

  <p><a name="sect97">§ 97</a>. Contrasted with the English, the
  Anglo-Saxon has (among others) the following differences.</p>

<p class="cenhead">NOUNS.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Gender.</i>&mdash;In Anglo-Saxon there were three genders, the
  masculine, the feminine, and the neuter. With <i>adjectives</i> each
  gender had its peculiar declension. With <!-- Page 66 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>[66]</span><i>substantives</i> also
  there were appropriate terminations, though only to a certain degree.</p>

  <p>2. The definite article varied with the gender of its substantive;
  <i>þæt eage</i>, the eye; <i>se steorra</i>, the star; <i>seo tunge</i>,
  the tongue.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Number.</i>&mdash;The plural form in <i>-en</i> (as in
  <i>oxen</i>), rare in English, was common in Anglo-Saxon. It was the
  regular termination of a whole declension; <i>e.g.</i>, <i>eágan</i>,
  eyes; <i>steorran</i>, stars; <i>tungan</i>, tongues. Besides this, the
  Anglo-Saxons had forms in <i>-u</i> and <i>-a</i> as <i>ricu</i>,
  kingdoms; <i>gifa</i>, gifts. The termination <i>-s</i>, current in the
  present English, was confined to a single gender and to a single
  declension, as <i>endas</i>, ends; <i>dagas</i>, days; <i>smiðas</i>,
  smiths.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Case.</i>&mdash;Of these the Saxons had, for their substantives,
  at least three; viz., the nominative, dative, genitive. With the pronouns
  and adjectives there was a true accusative form; and with a few especial
  words an ablative or instrumental one. <i>Smið</i>, a smith;
  <i>smiðe</i>, to a smith; <i>smiðes</i>, of a smith. Plural,
  <i>smiðas</i>, smiths; <i>smiðum</i>, to smiths; <i>smiða</i>, of smiths:
  <i>he</i>, he; <i>hine</i>, him; <i>him</i>, to him; <i>his</i>, his;
  <i>se</i>, the; <i>þa</i>, the; <i>þy</i>, with the; <i>þam</i>, to the;
  <i>þæs</i>, of the.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Declension.</i>&mdash;In <i>Anglo-Saxon</i> it was necessary to
  determine the declension of a substantive. There was the weak, or simple
  declension for words ending in a vowel (as, <i>eage</i>, <i>steorra</i>,
  <i>tunga</i>), and the strong declension for words ending in a consonant
  (<i>smið</i>, <i>spræc</i>, <i>leáf</i>). The letters <i>i</i> and
  <i>u</i> were dealt with as semivowels, semi-vowels being dealt with as
  consonants; so that words like <i>sunu</i> and <i>gifu</i> belonged to
  the same declension as <i>smið</i> and <i>spr&#x1FD;c</i>.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Definite and indefinite form of adjectives.</i>&mdash;In
  Anglo-Saxon each adjective had two forms, one <i>definite</i> <!-- Page
  67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>[67]</span>and one
  <i>indefinite</i>. There is nothing of this kind in English. We say <i>a
  good sword</i>, and <i>the good sword</i> equally. In Anglo-Saxon,
  however, the first combination would be <i>se gode sweord</i>, the second
  <i>án god sweord</i>, the definite form being distinguished from the
  indefinite by the addition of a vowel.</p>

  <p>7. <i>Pronouns personal.</i>&mdash;The Anglo-Saxon language had for
  the first two persons a <i>dual</i> number; inflected as follows:</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Pronouns of dual number." title="Pronouns of dual number.">
<tr><td class="spacsingle" colspan="3" align="center"><i>1st Person.</i></td><td class="spacsingle" colspan="3" align="center"><i>2nd Person.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="nspac"><i>Nom.</i></td><td class="spacsingle">Wit</td><td class="spacsingle"><i>We two</i></td><td class="nspac"><i>Nom.</i></td><td class="spacsingle">Git</td><td class="spacsingle"><i>Ye two</i></td></tr>

</table>

  <p>Besides this, the demonstrative, possessive, and relative pronouns, as
  well as the numerals <i>twa</i> and <i>þreo</i>, had a fuller declension
  than they have at present.</p>

<p class="cenhead">VERBS.</p>

  <p>8. <i>Mood.</i>&mdash;The subjunctive mood that in the present English
  (with one exception<a name="footnotetag41"
  href="#footnote41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>) differs from the indicative only
  in the third person singular, was in Anglo-Saxon considerably different
  from the indicative.</p>

  <p>The Saxon infinitive ended in <i>-an</i> (<i>lufian</i>), and besides
  this there was a so-called gerundial form, <i>to lufigenne</i>.</p>

  <p>Besides these there were considerable differences in respect to
  particular words; but of these no notice is taken; the object being to
  indicate the differences between the <i>ancient</i> and <i>modern</i>
  stages of a language in respect to <i>grammatical structure</i>.</p>

  <p>9. To bring about these changes a certain amount <i>of time</i> is, of
  course, necessary; a condition which suggests the difficult question as
  to the <i>rate</i> at which languages change. This is different for
  different languages; but as the investigation belongs to <i>general</i>
  philology rather than to the particular history of the English language,
  it finds no place here.</p>

  <p><a name="sect98">§ 98</a>. The extent, however, to which external
  causes may accelerate or retard philological changes, is <i>not</i>
  foreign to our subject; the influence of the Norman Conquest, upon the
  previous Anglo-Saxon foundation, being a problem of some difficulty.</p>

  <p>At the first glance it seems to have been considerable, especially in
  the way of simplifying the grammar. Yet the accuracy of this view is by
  no means unequivocal. The reasons against it are as follows:</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> In Friesland no such conquest took place. Yet the modern
  Frisian, as compared with the ancient, is nearly as simple in its
  grammatical structure, as the English is when compared with the
  Anglo-Saxon.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> In Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, no such conquest took place.
  Yet the modern Danish and Swedish, as compared with the Old Norse, are
  nearly as simple in their grammatical structure, as the English is, when
  compared with the Anglo-Saxon.</p>

  <p>The question requires more investigation than it has met with. <!--
  Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>[69]</span></p>

  <p>An extract from Mr. Hallam's "History of Literature" closes the
  present section, and introduces the next.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Nothing can be more difficult, except by an arbitrary line, than to
  determine the commencement of the English language; not so much, as in
  those on the Continent, because we are in want of materials, but rather
  from an opposite reason, the possibility of showing a very gradual
  succession of verbal changes that ended in a change of denomination. We
  should probably experience a similar difficulty, if we knew equally well
  the current idiom of France or Italy in the seventh and eighth centuries.
  For when we compare the earliest English of the thirteenth century with
  the Anglo-Saxon of the twelfth, it seems hard to pronounce why it should
  pass for a separate language, rather than a modification or
  simplification of the former. We must conform, however, to usage, and say
  that the Anglo-Saxon was converted into English:&mdash;1. By contracting
  and otherwise modifying the pronunciation and orthography of words. 2. By
  omitting many inflections, especially of the noun, and consequently
  making more use of articles and auxiliaries. 3. By the introduction of
  French derivatives. 4. By using less inversion and ellipsis, especially
  in poetry. Of these, the second alone, I think, can be considered as
  sufficient to describe a new form of language; and this was brought about
  so gradually, that we are not relieved from much of our difficulty, as to
  whether some compositions shall pass for the latest offspring of the
  mother, or the earlier fruits of the daughter's fertility. It is a proof
  of this difficulty that the best masters of our ancient language have
  lately introduced the word Semi-Saxon, which is to cover everything from
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1150 to <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  1250."&mdash;Chapter i. 47.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><a name="sect99">§ 99</a>. This shows that by the middle of the 12th
  century, the Anglo-Saxon of the standard Anglo-Saxon authors, had
  undergone such a change as to induce the scholars of the present ago to
  denominate it, not Saxon, but <i>Semi</i>-Saxon. It had ceased to be
  genuine Saxon, but had not yet become English.</p>

  <p>Some, amongst others, of the earlier changes of the standard
  Anglo-Saxon are,</p>

  <p>1. The substitution of <i>-an</i> for <i>-as</i>, in the plural of
  <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>[70]</span>substantives, <i>munucan</i> for
  <i>munucas</i> (<i>monks</i>); and, conversely, the substitution of
  <i>-s</i> for <i>-n</i>, as <i>steorres</i> for <i>steorran</i>
  (<i>stars</i>).</p>

  <p>2. The ejection or shortening of final vowels, <i>þæt ylc</i> for
  <i>þæt ylce</i>; <i>sone</i> for <i>sunu</i>; <i>name</i> for
  <i>nama</i>; <i>dages</i> for <i>dagas</i>.</p>

  <p>3. The substitution of <i>-n</i> for <i>-m</i> in the dative case,
  <i>hwilon</i> for <i>hwilum</i>.</p>

  <p>4. The ejection of the <i>-n</i> of the infinitive mood, <i>cumme</i>
  for <i>cuman</i> (<i>to come</i>), <i>nemne</i> for <i>nemnen</i> (<i>to
  name</i>).</p>

  <p>5. The ejection of <i>-en</i> in the participle passive, <i>I-hote</i>
  for <i>gehaten</i> (<i>called</i>, <i>hight</i>).</p>

  <p>6. The gerundial termination <i>-enne</i>, superseded by the
  infinitive termination <i>-en</i>; as <i>to lufian</i> for <i>to
  lufienne</i>, or <i>lufigenne</i>.</p>

  <p>7. The substitution of <i>-en</i> for <i>-að</i> in the persons plural
  of verbs; <i>hi clepen</i> (<i>they call</i>) for <i>hi clypiað</i>,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The preponderance (not the occasional occurrence) of forms like those
  above constitute <i>Semi-Saxon</i> in contradistinction to standard
  Saxon, classical Saxon, or Anglo-Saxon proper.</p>

  <p><a name="sect100">§ 100</a>. <i>Old English stage.</i>&mdash;Further
  changes convert Semi-Saxon into Old English. Some, amongst others, are
  the following:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The ejection of the dative plural termination <i>-um</i>, and the
  substitution of the preposition to and the plural sign <i>-s</i>; as
  <i>to smiths</i> for <i>smiðum</i>. Of the dative <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `sing-gular' across line break."
  >singular</span> the <i>-e</i> is retained (<i>ende</i>, <i>worde</i>);
  but it is by no means certain that, although recognized in writing, it
  was equally recognized in pronunciation also.</p>

  <p>2. The ejection of <i>-es</i> in the genitive singular whenever the
  preposition <i>of</i> came before it; <i>Godes love</i> (<i>God's
  love</i>), but the <i>love of God</i>, and not the <i>love of
  Godes</i>.</p>

  <p>3. The syllable <i>-es</i> as a sign of the genitive case <!-- Page 71
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>[71]</span>extended to all
  genders and to all declensions; <i>heart's</i> for <i>heortan</i>;
  <i>sun's</i> for <i>sunnan</i>.</p>

  <p>4. The same in respect to the plural number; <i>sterres</i> for
  <i>steorran</i>; <i>sons</i> for <i>suna</i>.</p>

  <p>5. The ejection of <i>-na</i> in the genitive plural; as <i>of
  tunges</i> for <i>tungena</i>.</p>

  <p>6. The use of the word <i>the</i>, as an article, instead of
  <i>se</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The <i>preponderance</i> of the forms above (and not their mere
  occasional occurrence) constitutes <i>Old English</i> in
  contradistinction to Semi-Saxon.</p>

  <p><a name="sect101">§ 101</a>. In the Old English the following forms
  predominate.</p>

  <p>1. A fuller inflection of the demonstrative pronoun, or definite
  article; <i>þan</i>, <i>þenne</i>, <i>þære</i>, <i>þam</i>;&mdash;in
  contradistinction to the Middle English.</p>

  <p>2. The presence of the dative singular in <i>-e</i>; <i>ende</i>,
  <i>smithe</i>.</p>

  <p>3. The existence of a genitive plural in <i>-r</i> or <i>-ra</i>;
  <i>heora</i>, theirs; <i>aller</i>, of all. This, with substantives and
  adjectives, is less common.</p>

  <p>4. The substitution of <i>heo</i> for <i>they</i>, of <i>heora</i> for
  <i>their</i>, of <i>hem</i> for <i>them</i>.</p>

  <p>5. A more frequent use of <i>min</i> and <i>thin</i>, for <i>my</i>
  and <i>thy</i>;&mdash;in contradistinction to both Middle and Modern
  English.</p>

  <p>6. The use of <i>heo</i> for <i>she</i>;&mdash;in contradistinction to
  Middle and Modern English and Old Lowland <i>Scotch</i>.</p>

  <p>7. The use of broader vowels; as in <i>iclep</i>u<i>d</i> or
  <i>iclep</i>o<i>d</i> (for <i>iclep</i>e<i>d</i> or
  <i>ycl</i>e<i>pt</i>); <i>geong</i>o<i>st</i>, youngest;
  <i>asc</i>o<i>de</i>, asked; <i>eld</i>o<i>re</i>, elder.</p>

  <p>8. The use of the strong preterits (<i>see</i> the chapter on the
  tenses of verbs), where in the present English the weak form is
  found&mdash;<i>wex</i>, <i>wop</i>, <i>dalf</i>, for <i>waxed</i>,
  <i>wept</i>, <i>delved</i>. <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page72"></a>[72]</span></p>

  <p>9. The omission not only of the gerundial termination <i>-enne</i>,
  but also of the infinitive sign <i>-en</i> after <i>to</i>; <i>to
  honte</i>, <i>to speke</i>;&mdash;in contradistinction to Semi-Saxon.</p>

  <p>10. The substitution of <i>-en</i> for <i>-eþ</i> or <i>-eð</i>, in
  the first and second persons plural of verbs; <i>we wollen</i>, we will:
  <i>heo schullen</i>, they should.</p>

  <p>11. The comparative absence of the articles <i>se</i> and
  <i>seo</i>.</p>

  <p>12. The substitution of <i>ben</i> and <i>beeth</i>, for <i>synd</i>
  and <i>syndon</i> = <i>we</i>, <i>ye</i>, <i>they are</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect102">§ 102</a>. Concerning the extent to which the
  Anglo-Norman was used, I retail the following statements and
  quotations.</p>

  <p>1. The distinction between the subjunctive and indicative mood is
  likely to pass away. We verify this by the very general tendency to say
  <i>if it is</i>, and <i>if he speaks</i>, rather than <i>if it be</i>,
  and <i>if he speak</i>.</p>

  <p>2. The distinction between the participle passive and the past tense
  is likely to pass away. We verify this by the tendency to say <i>it is
  broke</i>, and <i>he is smote</i>, for <i>it is broken</i> and <i>he is
  smitten</i>.</p>

<h3>PART III.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SOUNDS, LETTERS, PRONUNCIATION, SPELLING.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">GENERAL NATURE AND CERTAIN PROPERTIES OF ARTICULATE SOUNDS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect105">§ 105</a>. To two points connected with the subject
  of the following chapter, the attention of the reader is requested.</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> In the comparison of sounds the ear is liable to be misled
  by the eye. Thus&mdash;</p>

  <p>The syllables <i>ka</i> and <i>ga</i> are similar syllables. The vowel
  is in each the same, and the consonant is but slightly different. Hence
  the words <i>ka</i> and <i>ga</i> are more allied to each other than the
  words <i>ka</i> and <i>ba</i>, <i>ka</i> and <i>ta</i>, &amp;c., because
  the consonantal sounds of <i>k</i> and <i>g</i> are more allied than the
  consonantal sounds of <i>k</i> and <i>b</i>, <i>k</i> and <i>t</i>.</p>

  <p>Comparing the syllables <i>ga</i> and <i>ka</i>, we see the affinity
  between the sounds, and we see it at the first glance. It lies on the
  surface, and strikes the ear at once.</p>

  <p>It is, however, very evident that ways might be devised or might arise
  from accident, of concealing the <!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page78"></a>[78]</span>likeness between the two sounds, or, at any
  rate, of making it less palpable. One of such ways would be a faulty mode
  of spelling. If instead of <i>ga</i> we wrote <i>gha</i> the following
  would be the effect: the syllable would appear less simple than it really
  was; it would look as if it consisted of three parts instead of two, and
  consequently its affinity to <i>ka</i> would seem less than it really
  was. It is perfectly true that a little consideration would tell us that,
  as long as the sound remained the same, the relation of the two syllables
  remained the same also; and that, if the contrary appeared to be the
  case, the ear was misled by the eye. Still a little consideration would
  be required. Now in the English language we have (amongst others) the
  following modes of spelling that have a tendency to mislead;&mdash;</p>

  <p>The sounds of <i>ph</i> and of <i>f</i>, in <i>Philip</i> and
  <i>fillip</i>, differ to the eye, but to the ear are identical. Here a
  difference is simulated.</p>

  <p>The sounds of <i>th</i> in <i>thin</i>, and of <i>th</i> in
  <i>thine</i>, differ to the ear but to the eye seem the same. Here a
  difference is concealed.</p>

  <p>Furthermore. These last sounds appear to the eye to be double or
  compound. This is not the case; they are simple single sounds, and not
  the sounds of <i>t</i> followed by <i>h</i>, as the spelling leads us to
  imagine.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> Besides improper modes of spelling, there is another way of
  concealing the true nature of sounds. If I say that <i>ka</i> and
  <i>ga</i> are allied, the alliance is manifest; since I compare the
  actual <i>sounds</i>. If I say <i>ka</i> and <i>gee</i> are allied, the
  alliance is concealed; since I compare, not the actual sounds, but only
  the <i>names of the letters</i> that express those sounds. Now in the
  English language we have (amongst others) the following names of letters
  that have a tendency to mislead:&mdash; <!-- Page 79 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>[79]</span></p>

  <p>The sounds <i>fa</i> and <i>va</i> are allied. The names <i>eff</i>
  and <i>vee</i> conceal this alliance.</p>

  <p>The sounds <i>sa</i> and <i>za</i> are allied. The names <i>ess</i>
  and <i>zed</i> conceal the alliance.</p>

  <p>In comparing sounds it is advisable to have nothing to do either with
  letters or names of letters. Compare the sounds themselves.</p>

  <p><a name="sect106">§ 106</a>. In many cases it is sufficient, in
  comparing consonants, to compare syllables that contain those consonants;
  <i>e.g.</i>, in order to determine the relations of <i>p</i>, <i>b</i>,
  <i>f</i>, <i>v</i>, we say <i>pa</i>, <i>ba</i>, <i>fa</i>, <i>va</i>; or
  for those of <i>s</i> and <i>z</i>, we say <i>sa</i>, <i>za</i>. Here we
  compare <i>syllables</i>, each consonant being followed by a vowel. At
  times this is insufficient. We are often obliged to isolate the consonant
  from its vowel, and bring our organs to utter (or half utter) the
  imperfect sounds of <i>p'</i>, <i>b'</i>, <i>t'</i>, <i>d'</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect107">§ 107</a>. Let any of the <i>vowels</i> (for
  instance, the <i>a</i> in <i>father</i>) be sounded. The lips, the
  tongue, and the parts within the throat remain in the same position; and
  as long as these remain in the same position the sound is that of the
  vowel under consideration. Let, however, a change take place in the
  position of the organs of sound; let, for instance, the lips be closed,
  or the tongue be applied to the front part of the mouth: in that case the
  vowel sound is cut short. It undergoes a change. It terminates in a sound
  that is different, according to the state of those organs whereof the
  position has been changed. If, on the vowel in question, the lips be
  closed, there then arises an imperfect sound of <i>b</i> or <i>p</i>. If
  on the other hand, the tongue be applied to the front teeth, or to the
  forepart of the palate, the sound is one (more or less imperfect) of
  <i>t</i> or <i>d</i>. This fact illustrates the difference between the
  vowels and the consonants. It may be verified <!-- Page 80 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>[80]</span>by pronouncing the
  <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>, <i>ee</i> in <i>feet</i>, <i>oo</i> in
  <i>book</i>, <i>o</i> in <i>note</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>It is a further condition in the formation of a vowel sound, that the
  passage of the breath be uninterrupted. In the sound of the <i>l'</i> in
  <i>lo</i> (isolated from its vowel) the sound is as continuous as it is
  with the <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>. Between, however, the consonant
  <i>l</i> and the vowel <i>a</i> there is this difference: with <i>a</i>,
  the passage of the breath is uninterrupted; with <i>l</i>, the tongue is
  applied to the palate, breaking or arresting the passage of the
  breath.</p>

  <p><a name="sect108">§ 108</a>. The primary division of our articulate
  sounds is into vowels and consonants. The latter are again divided into
  liquids (<i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>r</i>) and mutes (<i>p</i>,
  <i>b</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>g</i>,
  <i>s</i>, <i>z</i>, &amp;c.).</p>

  <p><a name="sect109">§ 109</a>. <i>Sharp and flat.</i>&mdash;Take the
  sounds of <i>p</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>s</i>. Isolate them
  from their vowels, and pronounce them. The sound is the sound of a
  whisper.</p>

  <p>Let <i>b</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>z</i>, be similarly
  treated. The sound is no whisper, but one at the natural tone of our
  voice.</p>

  <p>Now <i>p</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>s</i> (with some others
  that will be brought forward anon) are <i>sharp</i>, whilst <i>b</i>,
  <i>v</i>, &amp;c., are <i>flat</i>. Instead of <i>sharp</i>, some say
  <i>hard</i>, and instead of <i>flat</i>, some say <i>soft</i>. The terms
  <i>sonant</i> and <i>surd</i> are, in a scientific point of view, the
  least exceptionable. They have, however, the disadvantage of being
  pedantic. The <i>tenues</i> of the classics (as far as they go) are
  sharp, the <i>mediæ</i> flat.</p>

  <p><a name="sect110">§ 110</a>. <i>Continuous and
  explosive.</i>&mdash;Isolate the sounds of <i>b</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>,
  <i>d</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>g</i>. Pronounce them. You have no power of
  prolonging the sounds, or of resting upon them. They escape with the
  breath, and they escape at once.</p>

  <p>It is not so with <i>f</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>sh</i>, <i>zh</i>. Here the
  breath is transmitted by degrees, and the sound can be drawn out and
  prolonged for an indefinite space of time. Now <i>b</i>, <i>p</i>,
  <i>t</i>, &amp;c., are explosive, <i>f</i>, <i>v</i>, &amp;c.,
  continuous. <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>[81]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect111">§ 111</a>. Concerning the vowels, we may predicate
  <i>a</i>) that they are all continuous, <i>b</i>) that they are all
  flat.</p>

  <p>Concerning the liquids, we may predicate <i>a</i>) that they are all
  continuous, <i>b</i>) that they are all flat.</p>

  <p>Concerning the mutes, we may predicate <i>a</i>) that one half of them
  is flat, and the other half sharp, and <i>b</i>) that some are
  continuous, and that others are explosive.</p>

  <p><a name="sect112">§ 112</a>.&mdash;The letter <i>h</i> is no
  <i>articulate</i> sound, but only a breathing.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">SYSTEM OF ARTICULATE SOUNDS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect113">§ 113</a>.&mdash;The attention of the reader is now
  directed to the following <i>foreign</i> vowel sounds.</p>

  <p>1. The <i>é fermé</i>, of the French.&mdash;This is a sound allied to,
  but different from, the <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>, and the <i>ee</i> in
  <i>feet</i>. It is intermediate to the two.</p>

  <p>2. The <i>u</i> of the French, <i>ü</i> of the Germans, <i>y</i> of
  the Danes.&mdash;This sound is intermediate to the <i>ee</i> in
  <i>feet</i>, and the <i>oo</i> in <i>book</i>.</p>

  <p>3. The <i>o chiuso</i>, of the Italians.&mdash;Intermediate to the
  <i>o</i> in <i>note</i>, and the <i>oo</i> in <i>book</i>.</p>

  <p>For these sounds we have the following sequences: <i>a</i> in
  <i>fate</i>, <i>é fermé</i>, <i>ee</i> in <i>feet</i>, <i>ü</i> in
  <i>übel</i> (German), <i>oo</i> in <i>book</i>, <i>o chiuso</i>, <i>o</i>
  in <i>note</i>. And this is the true order of alliance among the vowels;
  <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>, and <i>o</i> in <i>note</i>, being the extremes;
  the other sounds being transitional or intermediate. As the English
  orthography is at once singular and faulty, it exhibits the relationship
  but imperfectly.</p>

  <p><a name="sect114">§ 114</a>. <i>The system of the
  mutes.</i>&mdash;Preliminary to the consideration of the system of the
  mutes, let it be observed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>1. that the <i>th</i> in <i>thin</i> is a simple single sound,
  different from the <i>th</i> in <i>thine</i>, and that it may be
  expressed by the sign <i>þ</i>.</p>

  <p>2. That the <i>th</i> in <i>thine</i> is a simple single sound,
  different <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page83"></a>[83]</span>from the <i>th</i> in <i>thin</i>, and that
  it may be expressed by the sign <i>ð</i>.</p>

  <p>3. That the <i>sh</i> in <i>shine</i> is a simple single sound, and
  that it may be expressed by the sign <span class="grk">&sigma;</span><a
  name="footnotetag42" href="#footnote42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> (Greek <span
  title="sigma" class="grk">&sigma;&#x1FD6;&gamma;&mu;&alpha;</span>).</p>

  <p>4. That the <i>z</i> in <i>azure</i>, <i>glazier</i> (French <i>j</i>)
  is a simple single sound, and that it may be expressed by the sign <span
  class="grk">&zeta;</span><a href="#footnote42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> (Greek
  <span title="zêta" class="grk">&zeta;&#x1FC6;&tau;&alpha;</span>).</p>

  <p>5. That in the Laplandic, and possibly in many other languages, there
  are two peculiar sounds, different from any in English, German, and
  French, &amp;c., and that they may respectively be expressed by the sign
  <span class="grk">&kappa;</span> and the sign <span

</blockquote>

  <p><a name="sect115">§ 115</a>. With these preliminary notices we may
  exhibit the system of the sixteen mutes; having previously determined the
  meaning of two fresh terms, and bearing in mind what was said concerning
  the words <i>sharp</i> and <i>flat</i>, <i>continuous</i> and
  <i>explosive</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Lene and aspirate.</i>&mdash;From the sound of <i>p</i> in
  <i>pat</i>, the sound of <i>f</i> in <i>fat</i> differs in a certain
  degree. This difference is not owing to a difference in their sharpness
  or flatness. Each is sharp. Neither is it owing to a difference in their
  continuity or explosiveness; although <i>f</i> is continuous, whilst
  <i>p</i> is explosive. This we may ascertain by considering the position
  of <i>s</i>. The sound of <i>s</i> is <i>continuous</i>; yet <i>s</i>, in
  respect to the difference under consideration, is classed not with
  <i>f</i> the continuous sound but with <i>p</i> the explosive one. This
  difference, which has yet to be properly elucidated, is expressed by a
  particular term; and <i>p</i> is called <i>lene</i>, <i>f</i> is called
  <i>aspirate</i>.</p>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>As <i>f</i> is to <i>p</i> so is <i>v</i> to <i>b</i>.</p>
      <p>As <i>v</i> is to <i>b</i> so is <i>þ</i> to <i>t</i>.</p>
<!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>[84]</span>
      <p>As <i>þ</i> is to <i>t</i> so is <i>ð</i> to <i>d</i>.</p>
      <p>As <i>ð</i> is to <i>d</i> so is <span class="grk">&kappa;</span> to <i>k</i>.</p>
      <p>As <span class="grk">&kappa;</span> is to <i>k</i> so is <span class="grk">&gamma;</span> to <i>g</i>.</p>
      <p>As <span class="grk">&gamma;</span> is to <i>g</i> so is <span class="grk">&sigma;</span> to <i>s</i>.</p>
      <p>As <span class="grk">&sigma;</span> is to <i>s</i> so is <span class="grk">&zeta;</span> to <i>z</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Hence <i>p</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>g</i>,
  <i>s</i>, <i>z</i>, are <i>lene</i>; <i>f</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>þ</i>,

  <p><a name="sect116">§ 116</a>. I believe that in the fact of each mute

  <i>ng</i> in <i>sing</i>, <i>king</i>, <i>throng</i>, when at the end of
  a word, or of <i>singer</i>, <i>ringing</i>, &amp;c., in the middle of a
  word, is not the natural sound of the combination <i>n</i> and <i>g</i>,
  each letter retaining its natural power and sound; but a simple single
  sound, for which the combination <i>ng</i> is a conventional mode of
  expression.</p>

  <p><a name="sect122">§ 122</a>. Compared with <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>,

  <i>fate</i> being <i>slender</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect123">§ 123</a>. In <i>fat</i>, the vowel is, according to
  common parlance, <i>short</i>; in <i>fate</i>, it is <i>long</i>. Here we
  have the introduction of two fresh terms. For the words <i>long</i> and
  <i>short</i>, I substitute <i>independent</i> and <i>dependent</i>. If
  from the word <i>fate</i> I separate the final consonantal sound, the
  syllable <i>fa</i> remains. In this syllable the <i>a</i> <!-- Page 86
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>[86]</span>has precisely
  the sound that it had before. It remains unaltered. The removal of the
  consonant has in nowise modified its sound or power. It is not so,
  however, with the vowel in the word <i>fat</i>. If from this I remove the
  consonant following, and so leave the <i>a</i> at the end of the
  syllable, instead of in the middle, I must do one of two things: I must
  sound it either as the <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>, or else as the <i>a</i>
  in <i>father</i>. Its (so-called) short sound it cannot retain, unless it
  be supported by a consonant following. For this reason it is
  <i>dependent</i>. The same is the case with all the so-called short
  sounds, <i>viz.</i>, the <i>e</i> in <i>bed</i>, <i>i</i> in <i>fit</i>,
  <i>u</i> in <i>bull</i>, <i>o</i> in <i>not</i>, <i>u</i> in
  <i>but</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect124">§ 124</a>. It is not every vowel that is susceptible
  of every modification. <i>I</i> (<i>ee</i>) and <i>u</i> (<i>oo</i>) are
  incapable of becoming <i>broad</i>. The <i>e</i> in <i>bed</i>, although
  both broad and slender, is incapable of becoming <i>independent</i>. For
  the <i>u</i> in <i>but</i>, and for the <i>ö</i> of certain foreign
  languages, I have no satisfactory systematic position.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">OF CERTAIN COMBINATIONS OF ARTICULATE SOUNDS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect127">§ 127</a>. Certain combinations of articulate sounds
  are incapable of being pronounced. The following rule is one that, in the
  forthcoming pages, will frequently be referred to. <i>Two (or more)
  </i>mutes<i>, of different degrees of sharpness and flatness, are
  incapable of coming together in the same syllable.</i> For instance,
  <i>b</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>z</i>, &amp;c., being flat,
  and <i>p</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>s</i>, &amp;c., being
  sharp, such combinations as <i>abt</i>, <i>avt</i>, <i>apd</i>,
  <i>afd</i>, <i>agt</i>, <i>akd</i>, <i>atz</i>, <i>ads</i>, &amp;c., are
  unpronounceable. <i>Spelt</i>, indeed, they may be; but all attempts at
  <i>pronunciation</i> end in a <i>change</i> of the combination. In this
  case either the flat letter is really changed to its sharp equivalent
  (<i>b</i> to <i>p</i>, <i>d</i> to <i>t</i>, &amp;c.) or <i>vice
  versâ</i> (<i>p</i> to <i>b</i>, <i>t</i> to <i>d</i>). The combinations
  <i>abt</i> and <i>agt</i>, to be pronounced, must become either
  <i>apt</i> or <i>abd</i>, or else <i>akt</i> or <i>agd</i>.</p>

  <p>The word <i>mutes</i> in the third sentence of this section must be
  dwelt on. It is only with the <i>mutes</i> that there is an impossibility
  of pronouncing the heterogeneous combinations above-mentioned. The
  liquids and the vowels are flat; but the liquids and vowels, although
  flat, may be followed by a sharp consonant. If this were not the case,
  the combinations <i>ap</i>, <i>at</i>, <i>alp</i>, <i>alt</i>, &amp;c.,
  would be unpronounceable.</p>

  <p>The semivowels, also, although flat, admit of being followed by a
  sharp consonant. <!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page89"></a>[89]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect128">§ 128</a>. <i>Unstable combinations.</i>&mdash;That
  certain sounds in combination with others have a tendency to undergo
  farther changes, may be collected from the observation of our own
  language, as we find it spoken by those around us, or by ourselves. The
  diphthong <i>ew</i> is a sample of what may be called an unsteady or
  <i>unstable</i> combination. There is a natural tendency to change it
  either into <i>oo</i> or <i>yoo</i>; perhaps also into <i>yew</i>. Hence
  <i>new</i> is sometimes sounded <i>noo</i>, sometimes <i>nyoo</i>, and
  sometimes <i>nyew</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect129">§ 129</a>. <i>Effect of the semivowel </i>y<i> on
  certain letters when they precede it.</i>&mdash;Taken by itself the
  semivowel <i>y</i>, followed by a vowel (<i>ya</i>, <i>yee</i>,
  <i>yo</i>, <i>you</i>, &amp;c.), forms a stable combination. Not so,
  however, if it be preceded by a consonant, of the series <i>t</i> or
  <i>s</i>, as <i>tya</i>, <i>tyo</i>; <i>dya</i>, <i>dyo</i>; <i>sya</i>,
  <i>syo</i>. There then arises an unstable combination. <i>Sya</i> and
  <i>syo</i> we pronounce as <i>sha</i> and <i>sho</i>; <i>tya</i> and
  <i>tyo</i> we pronounce as <i>cha</i> and <i>ja</i> (<i>i.e.</i>,
  <i>tsh</i>, <i>dzh</i>). This we may verify from our pronunciation of
  words like <i>sure</i>, <i>picture</i>, <i>verdure</i> (<i>shoor</i>,
  <i>pictshoor</i>, <i>verdzhoor</i>), having previously remarked that the
  <i>u</i> in those words is not sounded as <i>oo</i> but as <i>yoo</i>.
  The effect of the semivowel <i>y</i>, taken with the instability of the
  combination <i>ew</i>, accounts for the tendency to pronounce <i>dew</i>
  as if written <i>jew</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect130">§ 130</a>. <i>Double consonants rare.</i>&mdash;It
  cannot be too clearly understood that in words like <i>pitted</i>,
  <i>stabbing</i>, <i>massy</i>, &amp;c., there is no real reduplication of
  the sounds of <i>t</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>s</i>, respectively. Between the
  words <i>pitted</i> (as with the small-pox) and <i>pitied</i> (as being
  an object of pity) there is a difference in spelling only. In speech the
  words are identical. <i>The reduplication of the consonant is, in English
  and the generality of languages, a <!-- Page 90 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>[90]</span>conventional mode of
  expressing in writing the shortness or dependence, of the vowel
  preceding.</i></p>

  <p><a name="sect131">§ 131</a>. Real reduplications of consonants,
  <i>i.e.</i>, reduplications of their <i>sound</i>, are, in all languages,
  extremely rare. In English they occur only under one condition. In
  <i>compound</i> and <i>derived</i> words, where the original root
  <i>ends</i>, and the superadded affix <i>begins</i>, with the same
  letter, there is a reduplication of the sound and not otherwise. In the
  word <i>soulless</i>, the <i>l</i> is doubled to the ear as well as to
  the eye; and it is a false pronunciation to call it <i>souless</i>
  (<i>soless</i>). In the "Deformed Transformed" it is made to rhyme with
  <i>no less</i>, improperly:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Clay, not dead but soulless,</p>
      <p class="i2">Though no mortal man would choose thee,</p>
      <p class="i1">An immortal no less</p>
      <p class="i2">Deigns not to refuse thee."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the following words, all of which are compounds, we have true
  specimens of the doubled consonant.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Doubled Consonants." title="Doubled Consonants.">
<tr><td class="nspac"><i>n</i>&nbsp;</td><td class="nspac">is doubled in&nbsp;</td><td class="nspac"><i>unnatural</i>, <i>innate</i>, <i>oneness</i>.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="nspac"><i>t</i></td><td class="nspac" align="center">&mdash;</td><td class="nspac"><i>seaport-town</i>.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>It must not, however, be concealed, that, in the mouths even of
  correct speakers, one of the doubled sounds is often dropped.</p>

  <p><a name="sect132">§ 132</a>. <i>True aspirates rare.</i>&mdash;The
  criticism applied to words like <i>pitted</i>, &amp;c., applies also to
  words like <i>Philip</i>, <i>thin</i>, <i>thine</i>, &amp;c. There is
  therein no sound of <i>h</i>. How the so-called aspirates differ from
  their corresponding lenes has not yet been determined. That it is
  <i>not</i> by the addition of <i>h</i> is evident. <i>Ph</i> and
  <i>th</i> are conventional modes of spelling simple single sounds, which
  might better be expressed by simple single signs. <!-- Page 91 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>[91]</span></p>

  <p>In our own language the <i>true</i> aspirates, like the true
  reduplications, are found only in compound words; and there they are
  often slurred in the pronunciation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">EUPHONY AND THE PERMUTATION OF LETTERS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect133">§ 133</a>. 1. Let there be two syllables of which
  the one ends in <i>m</i>, and the other begins with <i>r</i>, as we have
  in the syllables <i>num-</i> and <i>-rus</i> of the Latin word
  <i>numerus</i>.</p>

  <p>2. Let an ejection of the intervening letters bring these two
  syllables into immediate contact, <i>numrus</i>. The <i>m</i> and
  <i>r</i> form an unstable combination. To remedy this there is a tendency
  to insert an intervening sound.</p>

  <p>In English, the form which the Latin word <i>numerus</i> takes is
  <i>num</i>b<i>er</i>; in Spanish, <i>nom</i>b<i>re</i>. The <i>b</i>
  makes no part of the original word, but has been inserted for the sake of
  <i>euphony</i>; or, to speak more properly, by a euphonic process. The
  word euphony is derived from <span title="eu" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&#x1F56;</span> (<i>well</i>), and <span title="phônê" class="grk"
  >&phi;&#x1F7D;&nu;&eta;</span> (<i>fônæ</i>, a voice).</p>

  <p><a name="sect134">§ 134</a>. In the words <i>give</i> and <i>gave</i>
  we have a change of tense expressed by a change of vowel. In the words
  <i>price</i> and <i>prize</i> a change of meaning is expressed by a
  change of consonant. In <i>clothe</i> and <i>clad</i> there is a change
  both of a vowel and of a consonant. In the words <i>to use</i> and <i>a
  use</i> there is a similar change, although it is not expressed by the
  spelling. To the ear the verb <i>to use</i> ends in <i>z</i>, although
  not to the eye. All these are instances of the <i>permutation</i> of
  letters. <!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE FORMATION OF SYLLABLES.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect135">§ 135</a>. In respect to the formation of syllables,
  I am aware of no more than one point that requires any especial
  consideration.</p>

  <p>In certain words, of more than one syllable, it is difficult to say to
  which syllable an intervening consonant belongs. For instance, does the
  <i>v</i> in <i>river</i>, and the <i>e</i> in <i>fever</i>, belong to the
  first or the second syllable? Are the words to be divided thus,
  <i>ri-ver</i>, <i>fe-ver</i>? or thus, <i>riv-er</i>, <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `fe-ver'."
  ><i>feve-r</i></span>?</p>

  <p>The solution of the question lies by no means on the surface.</p>

  <p>In the first place, the case is capable of being viewed in two points
  of view&mdash;an etymological and a phonetic one.</p>

  <p>That the <i>c</i> and <i>r</i> in <i>become</i>, <i>berhymed</i>,
  &amp;c., belong to the second syllable, we determine at once by taking
  the words to pieces; whereby we get the words <i>come</i> and
  <i>rhymed</i> in an isolated independent form. But this fact, although it
  settles the point in etymology, leaves it as it was in phonetics; since
  it in nowise follows, that, because the <i>c</i> in the <i>simple</i>
  word <i>come</i> is exclusively attached to the letter that succeeds, it
  is, in the <i>compound</i> word <i>become</i>, exclusively attached to it
  also.</p>

  <p>To the following point of structure in the consonantal sounds the
  reader's attention is particularly directed. <!-- Page 96 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>[96]</span></p>

  <p>1. Let the vowel <i>a</i> (as in <i>fate</i>) be sounded.&mdash;2. Let
  it be followed by the consonant <i>p</i>, so as to form the syllable
  <i>&#x101;p</i>. To form the sound of <i>p</i>, it will be found that the
  lips close on the sound of <i>a</i>, and arrest it. Now, if the lips be
  left to themselves they will not <i>remain</i> closed on the sound, but
  will open again; in a slight degree indeed, but in a degree sufficient to
  cause a kind of vibration, or, at any rate, to allow an escape of the
  remainder of the current of breath by which the sound was originally
  formed. To re-open in a slight degree is the natural tendency of the lips
  in the case exhibited above.</p>

  <p>Now, by an effort, let this tendency to re-open be counteracted. Let
  the remaining current of breath be cut short. We have, then, only this,
  <i>viz.</i>, so much of the syllable <i>&#x101;p</i> as can be formed by
  the <i>closure</i> of the lips. All that portion of it that is caused by
  their re-opening is deficient. The resulting sound seems truncated, cut
  short, or incomplete. It is the sound of <i>p</i>, <i>minus</i> the
  remnant of breath. All of the sound <i>p</i> that is now left is formed,
  not by the <i>escape</i> of the breath, but by the <i>arrest</i> of
  it.</p>

  <p>The <i>p</i> in <i>&#x101;p</i> is a <i>final</i> sound. With initial
  sounds the case is different. Let the lips be <i>closed</i>, and let an
  attempt be made to form the syllable <i>pa</i> by suddenly opening them.
  The sound appears incomplete; but its incompleteness is at the
  <i>beginning</i> of the sound, and not at the end of it. In the natural
  course of things there would have been a current of breath
  <i>preceding</i>, and this current would have given a vibration, now
  wanting. All the sound that is formed here is formed, not by the
  <i>arrest</i> of breath, but by the <i>escape</i> of it.</p>

  <p>I feel that this account of the mechanism of the apparently simple
  sound <i>p</i>, labours under all the difficulties <!-- Page 97 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>[97]</span>that attend the
  <i>description</i> of a sound; and for this reason I again request the
  reader to satisfy himself either of its truth or of its inaccuracy,
  before he proceeds to the conclusions that will be drawn from it.</p>

  <p>The account, however, being recognized, we have in the sound of
  <i>p</i>, two elements:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. That formed by the current of air and the closure of the lips, as
  in <i>ap</i>. This may be called the sound of breath <i>arrested</i>.</p>

  <p>2. That formed by the current of air, and the opening of the lips, as
  in <i>pa</i>. This may be called the sound of breath <i>escaping</i>.</p>

  <p>Now what may be said of <i>p</i> may be said of all the other
  consonants, the words <i>tongue</i>, <i>teeth</i>, &amp;c., being used
  instead of <i>lips</i>, according to the case.</p>

  <p>Let the sound of breath <i>arrested</i> be expressed by <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span>, and that of breath <i>escaping</i> be expressed
  by <span class="grk">&#x3D6;</span>, the two together form <i>p</i>
  (<span class="grk">&pi;</span> + <span class="grk">&#x3D6;</span> =
  <i>p</i>).</p>

  <p>Thus <i>ap</i> (as quoted above) is <i>p</i> - <span
  class="grk">&#x3D6;</span>, or <span class="grk">&pi;</span>; whilst
  <i>pa</i> (sounded similarly) is <i>p</i> - <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span>, or <span class="grk">&#x3D6;</span>.</p>

  <p>In the formation of syllables, I consider that the sound of breath
  arrested belongs to the first, and the sound of breath escaping to the
  second syllable; that if each sound were expressed by a separate sign,
  the word <i>happy</i> would be divided thus, <i>ha</i><span
  class="grk">&pi;</span>-<span class="grk">&#x3D6;</span><i>y</i>; and
  that such would be the case with all consonants between two syllables.
  The <i>whole</i> consonant belongs neither to one syllable nor the other.
  Half of it belongs to each. The reduplication of the <i>p</i> in
  <i>happy</i>, the <i>t</i> in <i>pitted</i>, &amp;c., is a mere point of
  spelling.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON QUANTITY.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect136">§ 136</a>. The dependent vowels, as the <i>a</i> in
  <i>fat</i>, <i>i</i> in <i>fit</i>, <i>u</i> in <i>but</i>, <i>o</i> in
  <i>not</i>, have the character of being uttered with rapidity, and they
  pass quickly in the enunciation, the voice not resting on them. This
  rapidity of utterance becomes more evident when we contrast with them the
  prolonged sounds of the <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>, <i>ee</i> in
  <i>feet</i>, <i>oo</i> in <i>book</i>, or <i>o</i> in <i>note</i>;
  wherein the utterance is retarded, and wherein the voice rests, delays,
  or is prolonged. The <i>f</i> and <i>t</i> of <i>fate</i> are separated
  by a longer interval than the <i>f</i> and <i>t</i> of <i>fat</i>; and
  the same is the case with <i>fit</i>, <i>feet</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Let the <i>n</i> and the <i>t</i> of <i>not</i> be each as 1, the
  <i>o</i> also being as 1; then each letter, consonant or vowel, shall
  constitute &#x2153; of the whole word.</p>

  <p>Let, however, the <i>n</i> and the <i>t</i> of <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `not'."><i>note</i></span> be
  each as 1, the <i>o</i> being as 2. Then, instead of each consonant
  constituting &#x2153; of the whole word, it shall constitute but ¼.</p>

  <p>Upon the comparative extent to which the voice is prolonged, the
  division of vowels and syllables into <i>long</i> and <i>short</i> has
  been established: the <i>o</i> in <i>note</i> being long, the <i>o</i> in
  <i>not</i> being short. And the longness or shortness of a vowel or
  syllable is said to be its <i>quantity</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect137">§ 137</a>. Attention is directed to the word
  <i>vowel</i>. The longness or shortness of a <i>vowel</i> is one thing.
  The longness or shortness of a <i>syllable</i> another. This difference
  is <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page99"></a>[99]</span>important in prosody; especially in
  comparing the English with the classical metres.</p>

  <p>The vowel in the syllable <i>see</i> is long; and long it remains,
  whether it stand as it is, or be followed by a consonant, as in
  <i>see-n</i>, or by a vowel, as in <i>see-ing</i>.</p>

  <p>The vowel in the word <i>sit</i> is short. If followed by a vowel it
  becomes unpronounceable, except as the <i>ea</i> in <i>seat</i> or the
  <i>i</i> in <i>sight</i>. By a consonant, however, it <i>may</i> be
  followed. Such is the case in the word quoted&mdash;<i>sit</i>. Followed
  by a <i>second</i> consonant, it still retains its shortness,
  <i>e.g.</i>, <i>sits</i>. Whatever the comparative length of the
  <i>syllables</i>, <i>see</i> and <i>seen</i>, <i>sit</i> and <i>sits</i>,
  may be, the length of their respective <i>vowels</i> is the same.</p>

  <p>Now, if we determine the character of the syllable by the character of
  the vowel, all syllables are short wherein there is a short vowel, and
  all are long wherein there is a long one. Hence, measured by the quantity
  of the vowel, the word <i>sits</i> is short, and the syllable <i>see-</i>
  in <i>seeing</i> is long.</p>

  <p><a name="sect138">§ 138</a>. But it is well known that this view is
  not the view commonly taken of the syllables <i>see</i> (in
  <i>seeing</i>) and <i>sits</i>. It is well known, that, in the eyes of a
  classical scholar, the <i>see</i> (in <i>seeing</i>) is short, and that
  in the word <i>sits</i> the <i>i</i> is long.</p>

  <p>The classic differs from the Englishman thus,&mdash;<i>He measures his
  quantity, not by the length of the vowel, but by the length of the
  syllable taken altogether.</i> The perception of this distinction enables
  us to comprehend the following statements.</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> That vowels long by nature may <i>appear</i> to become short
  by position, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> That, by a laxity of language, the <i>vowel</i> may be said
  to have changed its quantity, whilst it is the <i>syllable</i> alone that
  has been altered. <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page100"></a>[100]</span></p>

  <p><i>c.</i> That if one person measures his quantities by the vowels,
  and another by the syllables, what is short to the one, shall be long to
  the other, and <i>vice versâ</i>. The same is the case with nations.</p>

  <p><i>d.</i> That one of the most essential differences between the
  English and the classical languages is that the quantities (as far as
  they go) of the first are measured by the vowel, those of the latter by
  the syllable. To a Roman the word <i>monument</i> consists of two short
  syllables and one long one; to an Englishman it contains three short
  syllables.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON ACCENT.</span></p>

  emphasis, or stress, upon the first syllable. In the word <i>presume</i>
  there is an emphasis, or stress, on the second syllable. This emphasis,
  or stress, is called <i>accent</i>. The circumstance of a syllable
  bearing an accent is sometimes expressed by a mark (&prime;); in which
  case the word is said to be accentuated, <i>i.e.</i>, to have the accent
  signified in writing.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ORTHOGRAPHY.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect142">§ 142</a>. <i>Orthoepy</i>, a word derived from the
  Greek <i>orthon</i> (<i>upright</i>), and <i>epos</i> (<i>a word</i>),
  signifies the right utterance of words. Orthoepy determines words, and
  deals with a language as it is <i>spoken</i>; <i>orthography</i>
  determines the correct spelling of words, and deals with a language as it
  is <i>written</i>. This latter term is derived from the Greek words
  <i>orthos</i> (<i>upright</i>), and <i>graphé</i>, or <i>grafæ</i>
  (<i>writing</i>). Orthography is less essential to language than
  orthoepy; since all languages are spoken, whilst but a few languages are
  written. Orthography presupposes orthoepy. Orthography addresses itself
  to the eye, orthoepy to the ear. Orthoepy deals with the articulate
  sounds that constitute syllables and words; orthography treats of the
  signs by which such articulate sounds are expressed in writing. A
  <i>letter</i> is the sign of an articulate (and, in the case of <i>h</i>,
  of an inarticulate) sound.</p>

  <p><a name="sect143">§ 143</a>. A full and perfect system of orthography
  consists in two things:&mdash;1. The possession of a sufficient and
  consistent alphabet. 2. The right application of such an alphabet. This
  position may be illustrated more fully.</p>

  <p><a name="sect144">§ 144</a>. First, in respect to a sufficient and
  consistent alphabet&mdash;Let there be in a certain language, simple
  single articulate sounds, to the number of forty, whilst the simple
  single signs, or letters, expressive of them, amount to no more than
  <i>thirty</i>. In this case the alphabet <!-- Page 104 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>[104]</span>is insufficient. It is
  not full enough: since ten of the simple single articulate sounds have no
  corresponding signs whereby they may be expressed. In our own language,
  the sounds (amongst others) of <i>th</i> in <i>thin</i>, and of <i>th</i>
  in <i>thine</i>, are simple and single, whilst there is no sign equally
  simple and single to spell them with.</p>

  <p><a name="sect145">§ 145</a>. An alphabet, however, may be sufficient,
  and yet imperfect. It may err on the score of inconsistency. Let there be
  in a given language two simple single sounds, (for instance) the <i>p</i>
  in <i>pate</i>, and the <i>f</i> in <i>fate</i>. Let these sounds stand
  in a given relation to each other. Let a given sign, for instance, <span
  lang="he" class="heb" title="P" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E4;</bdo></span>
  (as is actually the case in Hebrew), stand for the <i>p</i> in
  <i>pate</i>; and let a second sign be required for the <i>f</i> in
  <i>fate</i>. Concerning the nature of this latter sign, two views may be
  taken. One framer of the alphabet, perceiving that the two sounds are
  mere modifications of each other, may argue that no new sign (or letter)
  is at all necessary, but that the sound of <i>f</i> in <i>fate</i> may be
  expressed by a mere modification of the sign (or letter) <span lang="he"
  class="heb" title="P" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E4;</bdo></span>, and may be
  written thus <span lang="he" class="heb" title="P" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E4;&#x5BC;</bdo></span>, or thus <span lang="he"
  class="heb" title="P" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E4;</bdo></span>&prime; or
  <span lang="he" class="heb" title="P" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E4;</bdo></span>`, &amp;c.; upon the principle that like
  sounds should be expressed by like signs. The other framer of the
  alphabet, contemplating the difference between the two sounds, rather
  than the likeness, may propose, not a mere modification of the sign <span
  lang="he" class="heb" title="P" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E4;</bdo></span>,
  but a letter altogether new, such as <i>f</i>, or <span title="ph" class="grk"
  >&phi;</span>, &amp;c., upon the principle that sounds of a given degree
  of dissimilitude should be expressed by signs of a different degree of
  dissimilitude.</p>

  <p>Hitherto the expression of the sounds in point is a matter of
  convenience only. No question has been raised as to its consistency or
  inconsistency. This begins under conditions like the following:&mdash;Let
  there be in the language in point the sounds of the <i>t</i> in
  <i>tin</i>, <!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page105"></a>[105]</span>and of the <i>th</i> in <i>thin</i>; which
  (it may be remembered) are precisely in the same relation to each other
  as the <i>p</i> in <i>pate</i> and the <i>f</i> in <i>fate</i>. Let each
  of these sounds have a sign or letter expressive of it. Upon the nature
  of these signs, or letters, will depend the nature of the sign or letter
  required for the <i>f</i> in <i>fate</i>. If the letter expressing the
  <i>th</i> in <i>thin</i> be a mere modification of the letter expressing
  the <i>t</i> in <i>tin</i>, then must the letter expressive of the
  <i>f</i> in <i>fate</i> be a mere modification of the letter expressing
  the <i>p</i> in <i>pate</i>, and <i>vice versâ</i>. If this be not the
  case, the alphabet is inconsistent.</p>

  <p>In the English alphabet we have (amongst others) the following
  inconsistency:&mdash;The sound of the <i>f</i> in <i>fate</i>, in a
  certain relation to the sound of the <i>p</i> in <i>pate</i>, is
  expressed by a totally distinct sign; whereas, the sound of the <i>th</i>
  in <i>thin</i> (similarly related to the <i>t</i> in <i>tin</i>) is
  expressed by no new sign, but by a mere modification of <i>t</i>; viz.,
  <i>th</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect146">§ 146</a>. A third element in the faultiness of an
  alphabet is the fault of erroneous representation. The best illustration
  of this we get from the Hebrew alphabet, where the sounds of <span
  lang="he" class="heb" title="T" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5EA;</bdo></span> and
  <span lang="he" class="heb" title="T`" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D8;</bdo></span>, mere <i>varieties</i> of each other, are
  represented by distinct and dissimilar signs, whilst <span lang="he"
  class="heb" title="T" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5EA;</bdo></span> and <span
  lang="he" class="heb" title="T" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#xFB4A;</bdo></span>,
  sounds <i>specifically</i> distinct, are expressed by a mere modification
  of the same sign, or letter.</p>

  <p><a name="sect147">§ 147</a>. <i>The right application of an
  alphabet.</i>&mdash;An alphabet may be both sufficient and consistent,
  accurate in its representation of the alliances between articulate
  sounds, and in no wise redundant; and yet, withal, it may be so wrongly
  applied as to be defective. Of defect in the use or application of the
  letters of an alphabet, the three main causes are the
  following:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> <i>Unsteadiness in the power of letters.</i>&mdash;Of this
  there are two kinds. In the first, there is one sound with two (or more)
  ways of expressing it. Such is the sound of <!-- Page 106 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>[106]</span>the letter <i>f</i> in
  English. In words of Anglo-Saxon origin it is spelt with a single simple
  sign, as in <i>fill</i>; whilst in Greek words it is denoted by a
  combination, as in <i>Philip</i>. The reverse of this takes place with
  the letter <i>g</i>; here a single sign has a double power; in
  <i>gibbet</i> it is sounded as <i>j</i>, and in <i>gibberish</i> as
  <i>g</i> in <i>got</i>.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> <i>The aim at secondary objects.</i>&mdash;The natural aim
  of orthography, of spelling, or of writing, is to express the
  <i>sounds</i> of a language. Syllables and words it takes as they meet
  the ear, it translates them by appropriate signs, and so paints them, as
  it were, to the eye. That this is the natural and primary object is
  self-evident; but beyond this natural and primary object there is, with
  the orthographical systems of most languages, a secondary one,
  <i>viz.</i>, the attempt to combine with the representation of the sound
  of a given word, the representation of its history and origin.</p>

  <p>The sound of the <i>c</i>, in <i>city</i>, is the sound that we
  naturally spell with the letter <i>s</i>, and if the expression of this
  sound was the <i>only</i> object of our orthographists, the word would be
  spelt accordingly (<i>sity</i>). The following facts, however, traverse
  this simple view of the matter. The word is a derived word; it is
  transplanted into our own language from the Latin, where it is spelt with
  a <i>c</i> (<i>civitas</i>); and to change this <i>c</i> into <i>s</i>
  conceals the origin and history of the word. For this reason the <i>c</i>
  is retained, although, as far as the mere expression of sounds (the
  primary object in orthography) is concerned, the letter is a superfluity.
  In cases like the one adduced the orthography is bent to a secondary end,
  and is traversed by the etymology.</p>

  <p><i>c.</i> <i>Obsoleteness.</i>&mdash;It is very evident that modes of
  spelling which at one time may have been correct, may, by a change of
  pronunciation, become incorrect; so that <!-- Page 107 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>[107]</span>orthography becomes
  obsolete whenever there takes place a change of speech without a
  correspondent change of spelling.</p>

  <p><a name="sect148">§ 148</a>. From the foregoing sections we arrive at
  the theory of a full and perfect alphabet and orthography, of which a few
  (amongst many others) of the chief conditions are as follow:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. That for every simple single sound, incapable of being represented
  by a combination of letters, there be a simple single sign.</p>

  <p>2. That sounds within a determined degree of likeness be represented
  by signs within a determined degree of likeness; whilst sounds beyond a
  certain degree of likeness be represented by distinct and different
  signs, <i>and that uniformly</i>.</p>

  <p>3. That no sound have more than one sign to express it.</p>

  <p>4. That no sign express more than one sound.</p>

  <p>5. That the primary aim of orthography be to express the sounds of
  words, and not their histories.</p>

  <p>6. That changes of speech be followed by corresponding changes of
  spelling.</p>

  <p>With these principles in our mind we may measure the imperfections of
  our own and of other alphabets.</p>

  <p><a name="sect149">§ 149</a>. Previous to considering the sufficiency
  or insufficiency of the English alphabet, it is necessary to enumerate

  <p><a name="sect150">§ 150</a>. Some writers would add to these the
  additional sound of the <i>é fermé</i> of the French; believing that the
  vowel in words like <i>their</i> and <i>vein</i> has a different sound
  from the vowel in words like <i>there</i> and <i>vain</i>. For my own
  part I cannot detect such a difference either in my own speech or that of
  my neighbours; although I am far from denying that in certain
  <i>dialects</i> of our language such may have been the case. The
  following is an extract from the "Danish Grammar for Englishmen," by

  not the case with those that are now about to be noticed; for them,
  indeed, the word <i>defect</i> is somewhat too strong a term. They may
  more properly be termed inconveniences.</p>

  <p>Compared with the languages of the rest of the world the use of many
  letters in the English alphabet is <i>singular</i>. The letter <i>i</i>
  (when long or independent) is, with the exception of England, generally
  sounded as <i>ee</i>. With Englishmen it has a diphthongal power. The
  inconvenience of this is the necessity that it imposes upon us, in
  studying foreign languages, of unlearning the sound which we give it in
  our own, and of learning the sound which it bears in the language
  studied. So it is (amongst many others) with the letter <i>j</i>. In
  English this has the sound of <i>dzh</i>, in French of <i>zh</i>, and in
  German of <i>y</i>. From singularity in the use of letters arises
  inconvenience in the study of foreign tongues.</p>

  <p>In using <i>j</i> as <i>dzh</i> there is a second objection. It is not
  only inconvenient, but it is theoretically incorrect. <!-- Page 112
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>[112]</span>The letter
  <i>j</i> was originally a modification of the vowel <i>i</i>. The
  Germans, who used it as the semivowel <i>y</i>, have perverted it from
  its original power less than the English have done, who sound it
  <i>dzh</i>.</p>

  <p>With these views we may appreciate in the English alphabet and
  orthography&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Its convenience or inconvenience in respect to learning foreign
  tongues.</i>&mdash;The sound given to the <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i> is
  singular. Other nations sound it as <i>a</i> in <i>father</i>.</p>

  <p>The sound given to the <i>e</i>, long (or independent), is singular.
  Other nations sound it either as <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>, or as <i>é
  fermé</i>.</p>

  <p>The sound given to the <i>i</i> in <i>bite</i> is singular. Other
  nations sound it as <i>ee</i> in <i>feet</i>.</p>

  <p>The sound given to the <i>oo</i> in <i>fool</i> is singular. Other
  nations sound it as the <i>o</i> in <i>note</i>, or as the <i>ó
  chiuso</i>.</p>

  <p>The sound given to the <i>u</i> in <i>duck</i> is singular. Other
  nations sound it as the <i>u</i> in <i>bull</i>.</p>

  <p>The sound given to the <i>ou</i> in <i>house</i> is singular. Other
  nations, more correctly, represent it by <i>au</i> or <i>aw</i>.</p>

  <p>The sound given to the <i>w</i> in <i>wet</i> is somewhat singular,
  but is also correct and convenient. With many nations it is not found at
  all, whilst with those where it occurs it has the sound (there or
  thereabouts) of <i>v</i>.</p>

  <p>The sound given to <i>y</i> is somewhat singular. In Danish it has a
  vowel power. In German the semivowel sound is spelt with <i>j</i>.</p>

  <p>The sound given to <i>z</i> is not the sound which it has in German
  and Italian, but its power in English is convenient and correct.</p>

  <p>The sound given to <i>ch</i> in <i>chest</i> is singular. In other
  languages it has generally a guttural sound; in French that of <i>sh</i>.
  The English usage is more correct than the French, but less correct than
  the German. <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>[113]</span></p>

  <p>The sound given to <i>j</i> (as said before) is singular.</p>

  <p><a name="sect158">§ 158</a>. <i>The historical propriety or
  impropriety of certain letters.</i>&mdash;The use of <i>i</i> with a
  diphthongal power is not only singular and inconvenient, but also
  <i>historically incorrect</i>. The Greek <i>iota</i>, from whence it
  originates, has the sound of <i>i</i> and <i>ee</i>, as in <i>pit</i> and
  <i>feet</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>y</i>, sounded as in <i>yet</i>, is historically incorrect. It
  grew out of the Greek <span class="grk">&upsilon;</span>, a vowel, and no
  semivowel. The Danes still use it as such, that is, with the power of the
  German <i>ü</i>.</p>

  <p>The use of <i>j</i> for <i>dzh</i> is historically incorrect.</p>

  <p>The use of <i>c</i> for <i>k</i> in words derived from the Greek as
  <i>mechanical</i>, <i>ascetic</i>, &amp;c., is historically incorrect.
  The form <i>c</i> is the representative of <span
  class="grk">&gamma;</span> and <span class="grk">&sigma;</span> and not
  of the Greek <i>kappa</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect159">§ 159</a>. <i>On certain conventional modes of
  spelling.</i>&mdash;In the Greek language the sounds of <i>o</i> in
  <i>not</i> and of <i>o</i> in <i>note</i> (although allied) are expressed
  by the unlike signs (or letters) <span class="grk">&omicron;</span> and
  <span class="grk">&omega;</span>, respectively. In most other languages
  the difference between the sounds is considered too slight to require for
  its expression signs so distinct and dissimilar. In some languages the
  difference is neglected altogether. In many, however, it is expressed,
  and that by some modification of the original letter.</p>

  <p>Let the sign (&#x2C9;) denote that the vowel over which it stands is
  long, or independent, whilst the sign (&#x2D8;) indicates shortness, or
  dependence. In such a case, instead of writing <i>not</i> and <i>n<span
  class="grk">&omega;</span>t</i>, like the Greeks, we may write
  <i>n&#x14F;t</i> and <i>n&#x14D;t</i>, the sign serving for a fresh
  letter. Herein the expression of the nature of the sound is natural,
  because the natural use of (&#x2C9;) and (&#x2D8;) is to express length
  or shortness, dependence or independence. Now, supposing the broad sound
  of <i>o</i> to be <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>[114]</span>already represented, it is very evident
  that, of the other two sounds of <i>o</i>, the one must be long
  (independent), and the other short (dependent); and as it is only
  necessary to express one of these conditions, we may, if we choose, use
  the sign (&#x2C9;) alone; its presence denoting length, and its absence
  shortness (independence or dependence).</p>

  <p>As signs of this kind, one mark is as good as another; and instead of
  (&#x2C9;) we may, if we chose, substitute such a mark as (&prime;) and
  write <i>nót</i> = <i>n&#x14D;t</i> = <i>n<span
  class="grk">&omega;</span>t</i> = <i>n&#x14D;te</i>; provided only that
  the sign (&prime;) expresses no other condition or affection of a sound.
  This use of the mark (&prime;), as a sign that the vowel over which it is
  placed is long (independent), is common in many languages. But is this
  use of (&prime;) natural? For a reason that the reader has anticipated,
  it is not natural, but conventional. Neither is it convenient. It is used
  elsewhere not as the sign of <i>quantity</i>, but as the sign of
  <i>accent</i>; consequently, being placed over a letter, and being
  interpreted according to its natural meaning, it gives the idea, not that
  the syllable is long, but that it is emphatic or accented. Its use as a
  sign of quantity then, would be an orthographical expedient, or an
  inconvenient conventional mode of spelling.</p>

  <p>The English language abounds in orthographical expedients; the modes
  of expressing the quantity of the vowels being particularly numerous. To
  begin with these:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The reduplication of a vowel where there is but one syllable (as in
  <i>feet</i>, <i>cool</i>), is an orthographical expedient. It merely
  means that the syllable is long (or independent).</p>

  <p>The juxtaposition of two different vowels, where there is but one
  syllable (as in <i>plain</i>, <i>moan</i>), is an <!-- Page 115 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>[115]</span>orthographical
  expedient. It generally means the same as the reduplication of a vowel,
  <i>i.e.</i>, that the syllable is long (independent).</p>

  <p>The addition of the <i>e</i> mute, as in <i>plane</i>, <i>whale</i>
  (whatever may have been its origin), is, at present, but an
  orthographical expedient. It denotes the lengthening of the syllable.</p>

  <p>The reduplication of the consonant after a vowel, as in
  <i>spotted</i>, <i>torrent</i>, is in most cases but an orthographical
  expedient. It merely denotes that the preceding vowel is short
  (dependent).</p>

  <p>The use of <i>ph</i> for <i>f</i> in <i>Philip</i>, is an
  orthographical expedient, founded upon etymological reasons.</p>

  <p>The use of <i>th</i> for the simple sound of the first consonant in
  <i>thin</i> and <i>thine</i>, is an orthographical expedient. The
  combination must be dealt with as a single letter.</p>

  <p><i>Caution.</i>&mdash;The <span class="correction" title="Original reads `letter'."
  >letters</span> <i>x</i> and <i>q</i> are not orthographical expedients.
  They are orthographical <i>compendiums</i>, <i>x</i> = <i>ks</i>, and
  <i>q</i> = <i>kw</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE ENGLISH ALPHABET.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect160">§ 160</a>. The preceding chapter has exhibited the
  theory of a full and perfect alphabet; it has shown how far the English
  alphabet falls short of such a standard; and, above all, it has exhibited
  some of the conventional modes of spelling which the insufficiency of
  alphabets, combined with other causes, has engendered. The present
  chapter gives a <i>history</i> of our alphabet, whereby many of its
  defects are <i>accounted for</i>. These defects, it may be said, once for
  all, the English alphabet shares with those of the rest of the world;
  although, with the doubtful exception of the French, it possesses them in
  a higher degree than any.</p>

  <p>With few, if any exceptions, <i>all the modes of writing in the world
  originate</i>, directly or indirectly, from the Ph&oelig;nician.</p>

  <p>At a certain period the alphabet of Palestine, Ph&oelig;nicia, and the
  neighboring languages of the Semitic tribes, consisted of
  <i>twenty-two</i> separate and distinct letters.</p>

  <p>Now the chances are, that, let a language possess as few elementary
  articulate sounds as possible, an alphabet of only <i>twenty-two</i>
  letters will be insufficient.</p>

  <p>Hence it may safely be asserted, that the original Semitic alphabet
  was <i>insufficient</i> for even the <i>Semitic</i> languages.</p>

  <p><a name="sect161">§ 161</a>. In this state it was imported into
  Greece. <!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page117"></a>[117]</span>Now, as it rarely happens that any two
  languages have precisely the same elementary articulate sounds, so it
  rarely happens that an alphabet can be transplanted from one tongue to
  another, and be found to suit. When such is the case, alterations are
  required. The extent to which these alterations are made at all, or (if
  made) made on a right principle varies with different languages. Some
  <i>adapt</i> an introduced alphabet well: others badly.</p>

  <p>Of the <i>twenty-two</i> Ph&oelig;nician letters the Greeks took but
  <i>twenty-one</i>. The eighteenth letter, <i>tsadi</i> <span lang="he"
  class="heb" title="TS" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E6;</bdo></span> was never
  imported into Europe.</p>

  <p>Compared with the Semitic, the <i>Old</i> Greek alphabet ran
  thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The alphabet of Ph&oelig;nicia and Palestine being adapted to the
  language of Greece, the first change took place in the manner of writing.
  The Ph&oelig;nicians wrote from right to left; the Greeks from left to
  right. Besides this, the following principles were recognised;&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> Letters for which there was no use were left behind. This
  was the case, as seen above, with the eighteenth letter,
  <i>tsadi</i>.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> Letters expressive of sounds for which there was no precise
  equivalent in Greek, were used with other powers. This was the case with
  letters 5, 8, 16, and probably with some others.</p>

  <p><i>c.</i> Letters of which the original sound, in the course of time,
  became changed, were allowed, as it were, to drop out of the alphabet.
  This was the case with 6 and 19.</p>

  <p><i>d.</i> For such simple single elementary articulate sounds as there
  was no sign or letter representant, new signs, or letters, were invented.
  This principle gave to the Greek alphabet the new signs <span
  class="grk">&phi;</span>, <span class="grk">&chi;</span>, <span
  class="grk">&upsilon;</span>, <span class="grk">&omega;</span>.</p>

  <p><i>e.</i> The new signs were not mere modifications of the older ones,
  but totally new letters.</p>

  <p>All this was correct in principle; and the consequence is, that the
  Greek alphabet, although not originally meant to express a European
  tongue at all, expresses the Greek language well.</p>

  <p><a name="sect162">§ 162</a>. But it was not from the Greek that our
  own alphabet was immediately derived; although ultimately <!-- Page 119
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>[119]</span>it is
  referable to the same source as the Greek, <i>viz.</i>, the
  Ph&oelig;nician.</p>

  <p>It was the <i>Roman</i> alphabet which served as the basis to the
  English.</p>

  <p>And it is in the changes which the Ph&oelig;nician alphabet underwent
  in being accommodated to the Latin language that we must investigate the
  chief peculiarities of the present alphabet and orthography of Great
  Britain and America.</p>

  <p>Now respecting the Roman alphabet, we must remember that it was
  <i>not</i> taken <i>directly</i> from the Ph&oelig;nician; in this
  important point differing from the Greek.</p>

  <p>Nor yet was it taken, <i>in the first instance</i>, from the
  Greek.</p>

  <p>It had a <i>double</i> origin.</p>

  <p>The operation of the principles indicated in § <a
  href="#sect161">161</a> was a work of the time; and hence the older and
  more unmodified Greek alphabet approached in character its
  Ph&oelig;nician prototype much more than the later, or modified. As may
  be seen, by comparing the previous alphabets with the common alphabets of
  the Greek Grammar, the letters 6 and 19 occur in the earlier, whilst they
  are missing in the later, modes of writing. On the other hand, the
  <i>old</i> alphabet has no such signs as <span class="grk">&phi;</span>,
  <span class="grk">&chi;</span>, <span class="grk">&upsilon;</span>, <span
  class="grk">&omega;</span>, <span class="grk">&psi;</span>, and <span
  class="grk">&xi;</span>.</p>

  <p>Such being the case, it is easy to imagine what would be the
  respective conditions of two Italian languages which borrowed those
  alphabets, the one from the earlier, the other from the later Greek. The
  former would contain the equivalents to <i>vaw</i> (6), and <i>kof</i>
  (19); but be destitute of <span class="grk">&phi;</span>, <span
  class="grk">&chi;</span>, &amp;c.; whereas the latter would have <span
  class="grk">&phi;</span>, <span class="grk">&chi;</span>, &amp;c., but be
  without either <i>vaw</i> or <i>kof</i>.</p>

  <p>Much the same would be the case with any single <!-- Page 120 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>[120]</span>Italian language which
  took as its basis the <i>earlier</i>, but adopted, during the course of
  time, modifications from the <i>later</i> Greek. It would exhibit within
  itself characters common to the two stages.</p>

  <p>This, or something very like it, was the case with Roman. For the
  first two or three centuries the alphabet was Etruscan; Etruscan derived
  <i>directly</i> from the Greek, and from the <i>old</i> Greek.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, however, the later Greek alphabet had its influence, and
  the additional letters which it contained were more or less incorporated;
  and that without effecting the ejection of any earlier ones.</p>

  <p><a name="sect163">§ 163</a>. With these preliminaries we may
  investigate the details of the Roman alphabet, when we shall find that
  many of them stand in remarkable contrast with those of Greece and
  Ph&oelig;nicia. At the same time where they differ with them, they agree
  with the English.</p>

</table>

  <p><a name="sect164">§ 164</a>. The differences of this table are
  referable to one of the following four heads:&mdash;<i>a.</i> Ejection.
  <i>b.</i> Addition. <i>c.</i> Change of power. <i>d.</i> Change of
  order.</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> <i>Ejection.</i>&mdash;In the first instance, the Italians
  ejected as unnecessary, letters 7,<a name="footnotetag44"
  href="#footnote44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> 9, and 11: <i>zayn</i>
  (<i>zæta</i>), <i>teth</i> (<i>thæta</i>), and <i>kaf</i> (<i>kappa</i>).
  Either the sounds which they expressed were wanting in their language; or
  else they were expressed by some other letter. The former was probably
  the case with 7 and 9, <i>zæta</i> and <i>thæta</i>, the latter with 11,
  <i>kappa</i>.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> <i>Addition.</i>&mdash;Out of the Greek <i>iôta</i>, two;
  out of the Greek <i>upsilon</i>, four modifications have been evolved;
  viz., <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> out of <span class="grk">&iota;</span>, and
  <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>y</i>, out of <span
  class="grk">&upsilon;</span>.</p>

  <p><i>c.</i> <i>Change of power.</i>&mdash;Letter 3, in Greek and Hebrew
  had the sound of the <i>g</i> in <i>gun</i>; in Latin that of <i>k</i>.
  The reason for this lies in the structure of the Etruscan language. In
  that tongue the <i>flat</i> sounds were remarkably deficient; indeed, it
  is probable, that that of <i>g</i> was wanting. Its <i>sharp</i>
  equivalent, however, the sound of <i>k</i>, was by no means wanting; and
  the Greek <i>gamma</i> was used to denote it. This made the equivalent to
  <i>k</i>, the third letter of the alphabet, as early as the time of the
  Etruscans.</p>

  <p>But the <i>Romans</i> had both sounds, the <i>flat</i> as well as <!--
  Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>[122]</span>the
  <i>sharp</i>, <i>g</i> as well as <i>k</i>. How did they express them? Up
  to the second Punic War they made the rounded form of the Greek <span
  class="grk">&Gamma;</span>, out of which the letter C has arisen, do
  double work, and signify <i>k</i> and <i>g</i> equally, just as in the
  present English <i>th</i> is sounded as the Greek <span
  class="grk">&theta;</span>,<a name="footnotetag45"
  href="#footnote45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> and as <i>dh</i>;<a
  name="footnotetag46" href="#footnote46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> in proof
  whereof we have in the Duillian column, <span class="scac">MACESTRATOS =
  MAGISTRATOS</span>, and <span class="scac">CARTHACINIENSES =
  CARTHAGINIENSES</span>.</p>

  <p>Thus much concerning the power and places of the Latin <i>c</i>, as
  opposed to the Greek <span class="grk">&gamma;</span>. But this is not
  all. The use of <i>gamma</i>, with the power of <i>k</i>, made
  <i>kappa</i> superfluous, and accounts for its ejection in the
  <i>Etruscan</i> alphabet; a fact already noticed.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, an addition to the Etruscan alphabet was required by the
  existence of the sound of <i>g</i>, in Latin, as soon as the
  inconvenience of using <i>c</i> with a double power became manifest. What
  took place then? Even this. The third letter was modified in form, or
  became a new letter, <i>c</i> being altered into <i>g</i>; and the new
  letter took its place in the alphabet.</p>

  <p>Where was this? As the <i>seventh</i> letter between <i>f</i>
  (<i>digamma</i>) and <i>h</i> (<i>hæta</i>).</p>

  <p>Why? Because it was there where there was a vacancy, and where it
  replaced the Greek <i>zæta</i>, or the Hebrew <i>zayn</i>, a letter
  which, <i>at that time</i>, was not wanted in Latin.</p>

  <p><i>d.</i> <i>Change of order.</i>&mdash;As far as the letters <i>c</i>
  and <i>g</i> are concerned, this has been explained; and it has been
  shown that change of order and change of power are sometimes very closely
  connected. All that now need be added is, that those letters which were
  <i>last</i> introduced from the Greek into the Roman alphabet, were
  placed at the end.</p>

<p><!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>[123]</span></p>

  <p>This is why <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>w</i>, and <i>y</i> come after
  <i>t</i>&mdash;the last letter of the original Ph&oelig;nician, and also
  of the <i>older</i> Greek.</p>

  <p>This, too, is the reason for <i>z</i> coming last of all. It was
  restored for the purpose of spelling Greek words. But as its original
  place had been filled up by <i>g</i>, it was tacked on as an appendage,
  rather than incorporated as an element.</p>

  <p><i>X</i> in <i>power</i>, coincided with the Greek <i>xi</i>; in
  <i>place</i>, with the Greek <i>khi</i>. Its <i>position</i> seems to
  have determined its <i>form</i>, which is certainly that of <i>X</i>
  rather than of <span class="grk">&Xi;</span>. The full investigation of
  this is too lengthy for the present work.</p>

  <p><a name="sect165">§ 165</a>. It should be observed, that, in the
  Latin, the letters have no longer any <i>names</i> (like <i>beth</i>,
  <i>bæta</i>), except such as are derived from their powers (<i>be</i>,
  <i>ce</i>).</p>

  <p><a name="sect166">§ 166</a>. The principles which determined the form
  of the Roman alphabet were, upon the whole, correct; and, hence, the
  Roman alphabet, although not originally meant to express an Italian
  tongue at all, expressed the language to which it was applied
  tolerably.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there were both omissions and alterations which
  have had a detrimental effect upon the orthography of those other
  numerous tongues to which Latin has supplied the alphabet.
  Thus&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> It is a matter of regret, that the differences which the
  Greeks drew between the so-called <i>long</i> and <i>short</i> <i>e</i>
  and <i>o</i>, was neglected by the Latins; in other words, that <span
  class="grk">&omega;</span> was omitted entirely, and <span
  class="grk">&eta;</span> changed in power. Had this been the case, all
  the orthographical expedients by which we have to express the difference
  between the <i>o</i> in <i>not</i>, and the <i>o</i> in <i>note</i>,
  would have been prevented&mdash;<i>not</i>, <i>note</i>,
  <i>moat</i>&mdash;<i>bed</i>, <i>bead</i>, <i>heel</i>, <i>glede</i>,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> It is a matter of regret, that such an unnecessary <!-- Page
  124 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page124"></a>[124]</span><i>compendium</i> as <i>q</i> = <i>cu</i>,
  or <i>cw</i>, should have been retained from the old Greek alphabet; and,
  still more so, that the equally superfluous <i>x</i> = <i>cs</i>, or
  <i>ks</i>, should have been re-admitted.</p>

  <p>c. It is a matter of regret, that the Greek <span
  class="grk">&theta;</span> was not treated like the Greek <span
  class="grk">&zeta;</span>. Neither were wanted at first; both afterwards.
  The manner, however, of their subsequent introduction was different.
  <i>Zæta</i> came in as a simple single letter, significant of a simple
  single sound. <i>Thæta</i>, on the contrary, although expressive of an
  equally simple sound, became <i>th</i>. This was a combination rather
  than a letter; and the error which it engendered was great.</p>

  <p>It suggested the idea, that a simple sound was a compound
  one&mdash;which was wrong.</p>

  <p>It further suggested the idea, that the sound of <span
  class="grk">&theta;</span> differed from that of <span
  class="grk">&tau;</span>, by the addition of <i>h</i>&mdash;which was
  wrong also.</p>

  <p><a name="sect167">§ 167</a>. The Greek language had a system of sounds
  different from the Ph&oelig;nician; and the alphabet required modifying
  accordingly.</p>

  <p>The Roman language had a system of sounds different from the Greek and
  the alphabet required modifying accordingly.</p>

  <p>This leads us to certain questions concerning the Anglo-Saxon. Had
  <i>it</i> a system of sounds different from the Roman? If so, what
  modifications did the alphabet require? Were such modifications effected?
  If so, how? Sufficiently or insufficiently? The answers are
  unsatisfactory.</p>

  <p><a name="sect168">§ 168</a>. The Anglo-Saxon had, even in its earliest
  stage, the following sounds, for which the Latin alphabet had no
  equivalent signs or letters&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The sound of the <i>th</i> in <i>thin</i>. <!-- Page 125 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>[125]</span></p>

  <p>2. The sound of the <i>th</i> in <i>thine</i>.</p>

  <p>It had certainly these: probably others.</p>

  <p><a name="sect169">§ 169</a>. Expressive of these, two new signs were
  introduced, <i>viz.</i>, <i>þ</i> = <i>th</i> in <i>thin</i>, and
  <i>ð</i> = <i>th</i> in <i>thine</i>.</p>

  <p><i>W</i>, also evolved out of <i>u</i>, was either an original
  improvement of the Anglo-Saxon orthographists, or a mode of expression
  borrowed from one of the allied languages of the Continent. Probably the
  latter was the case; since we find the following passage in the Latin
  dedication of Otfrid's "Krist:"&mdash;"Hujus enim linguæ barbaries, ut
  est inculca et indisciplinabilis, atque insueta capi regulari freno
  grammaticæ artis, sic etiam in multis dictis scriptu est difficilis
  propter literarum aut congeriem, aut incognitam sonoritatem. Nam interdum
  tria <i>u u u</i> ut puto quærit in sono; priores duo consonantes, ut
  mihi videtur, tertium vocali sono manente."</p>

  <p>This was, as far as it went, correct, so that the Anglo-Saxon
  alphabet, although not originally meant to express a Gothic tongue at
  all, answered the purpose to which it was applied tolerably.</p>

  <p><a name="sect170">§ 170</a>. Change, however, went on; and the
  orthography which suited the earlier Anglo-Saxon would not suit the
  later; at any rate, it would not suit the language which had become or
  was becoming, <i>English</i>; wherein the sounds for which the Latin
  alphabet had no equivalent signs increase. Thus there is at
  present&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The sound of the <i>sh</i> in <i>shine</i>.</p>

  <p>2. The sound of the <i>z</i> in <i>azure</i>.</p>

  <p>How are these to be expressed? The rule has hitherto been to denote
  simple single sounds, by simple single signs, and where such signs have
  no existence already, to <i>originate new ones</i>.</p>

  <p>To <i>combine existing letters</i>, rather than to coin a new one, has
  only been done rarely. The Latin substitution <!-- Page 126 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>[126]</span>of the combination
  <i>th</i> for the simple single <span class="grk">&theta;</span>, was
  exceptionable. It was a precedent, however, which now begins to be
  followed generally.</p>

  <p><a name="sect171">§ 171</a>. It is this precedent which accounts for
  the absence of any letter in English, expressive of either of the sounds
  in question.</p>

  <p><a name="sect172">§ 172</a>. Furthermore, our alphabet has not only
  not increased in proportion to our sound-system, but it has
  <i>decreased</i>. The Anglo-Saxon <i>þ</i> = the <i>th</i> in
  <i>thin</i>, and <i>ð</i> = the <i>th</i> in <i>thine</i>, have become
  obsolete; and a difference in pronunciation, which our ancestors
  expressed, <i>we</i> overlook.</p>

  <p>The same precedent is at the bottom of this; a fact which leads us
  to&mdash;</p>

  <p><a name="sect173">§ 173</a>. <i>The Anglo-Norman
  alphabet.</i>&mdash;The Anglo-Saxon language was <i>Gothic</i>; the
  alphabet, <i>Roman</i>.</p>

  <p>The Anglo-Norman language was <i>Roman</i>; the alphabet, <i>Roman</i>
  also.</p>

  <p>The Anglo-Saxon took his speech from one source; his writing from
  another.</p>

  <p>The Anglo-Norman took both from the same.</p>

  <p>In adapting a Latin alphabet to a Gothic language, the Anglo-Saxon
  allowed himself more latitude than the Anglo-Norman. We have seen that
  the new signs <i>þ</i> and <i>ð</i> were Anglo-Saxon.</p>

  <p>Now the sounds which these letters represent did not occur in the
  Norman-French, consequently the Norman-French alphabet neither had nor
  needed to have signs to express them; until after the battle of Hastings,
  <i>when it became the Anglo-Norman of England</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Then</i>, the case became altered. The English language influenced
  the Norman orthography, and the Norman orthography the English language;
  and the result was, that the simple single correct and distinctive <!--
  Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>[127]</span>signs
  of the Anglo-Saxon alphabet, became replaced by the incorrect and
  indistinct combination <i>th</i>.</p>

  <p>This was a loss, both in the way of theoretical correctness and
  perspicuity.</p>

  <p>Such is the general view of the additions, ejections, changes of
  power, and changes of order in the English alphabet. The extent, however,
  to which an alphabet is faulty, is no measure of the extent to which an
  orthography is faulty; since an insufficient alphabet may, by consistency
  in its application, be more useful than a full and perfect alphabet
  unsteadily applied.</p>

  <p><a name="sect174">§ 174</a>. One of our orthographical expedients,
  <i>viz.</i>, the reduplication of the consonant following, to express the
  shortness (dependence) of the preceding vowel, is as old as the classical
  languages: <i>terra</i>, <span title="thalassa" class="grk"
  >&theta;&#x1F71;&lambda;&alpha;&sigma;&sigma;&alpha;</span>.
  Nevertheless, the following extract from the "Ormulum" (written in the
  thirteenth century) is the fullest recognition of the practice that I
  have met with.</p>

  in the number and power of its letters. The following question now
  presents itself: <i>viz.</i>, Is there in the order of the letters any

<h3>PART IV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">ETYMOLOGY.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE PROVINCE OF ETYMOLOGY.</span></p>

  <p><span class="correction" title="Original reads `§ 175'."><a
  name="sect176">§ 176</a></span>. The word etymology, derived from the
  Greek, in the current language of scholars and grammarians, has a double
  meaning. At times it is used in a wide, and at times in a restricted
  sense.</p>

  <p>If in the English language we take such a word as <i>fathers</i>, we
  are enabled to divide it into two parts; in other words, to reduce it
  into two elements. By comparing it with the word <i>father</i>, we see
  that the <i>s</i> is neither part nor parcel of the original word. Hence
  the word is capable of being analysed; <i>father</i> being the original
  primitive word, and <i>s</i> the secondary superadded termination. From
  the word <i>father</i>, the word <i>fathers</i> is <i>derived</i>, or
  (changing the expression) deduced, or descended. What has been said of
  the word <i>fathers</i> may also be said of <i>fatherly</i>,
  <i>fatherlike</i>, <i>fatherless</i>, &amp;c. Now, from the word
  <i>father</i>, all these words (<i>fathers</i>, <i>fatherly</i>,
  <i>fatherlike</i>, and <i>fatherless</i>) differ in form and in meaning.
  To become such a word as <i>fathers</i>, &amp;c., the <!-- Page 132
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>[132]</span>word
  <i>father</i> is <i>changed</i>. Of changes of this sort, it is the
  province of etymology to take cognizance.</p>

  <p><a name="sect177">§ 177</a>. Compared with the form <i>fathers</i>,
  the word <i>father</i> is the older form of the two. The word
  <i>father</i> is a word current in this the nineteenth century. The same
  word is found much earlier, under different forms, and in different
  languages. Thus, in the Latin language, the form was <i>pater</i>; in
  Greek, <span title="patêr" class="grk"
  >&pi;&alpha;&tau;&#x1F75;&rho;</span>. Now, with <i>father</i> and
  <i>fathers</i>, the change takes place within the same language, whilst
  the change that takes place between <i>pater</i> and <i>father</i> takes
  place within different languages. Of changes of this latter kind it is,
  also, the province of etymology to take cognizance.</p>

  <p><a name="sect178">§ 178</a>. In its widest signification, etymology
  takes cognizance <i>of the changes of the form of words</i>. However, as
  the etymology that compares the forms <i>fathers</i> and <i>father</i> is
  different from the etymology that compares <i>father</i> and
  <i>pater</i>, we have, of etymology, two sorts: one dealing with the
  changes of form that words undergo in one and the same language
  (<i>father</i>, <i>fathers</i>), the other dealing with the changes that
  words undergo in passing from one language to another (<i>pater</i>,
  <i>father</i>).</p>

  <p>The first of these sorts may be called etymology in the limited sense
  of the word, or the etymology of the grammarian. In this case it is
  opposed to orthoepy, orthography, syntax, and the other parts of grammar.
  This is the etymology of the ensuing pages.</p>

  <p>The second may be called etymology in the wide sense of the word,
  <i>historical</i> etymology, or <i>comparative</i> etymology.</p>

  <p><a name="sect179">§ 179</a>. It must be again repeated that the two
  sorts of etymology agree in one point, viz., in taking cognizance of the
  <i>changes of forms that words undergo</i>. Whether the change arise from
  grammatical reasons, as <!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page133"></a>[133]</span><i>father</i>, <i>fathers</i>, or from a
  change of language taking place in the lapse of time, as <i>pater</i>,
  <i>father</i>, is a matter of indifference.</p>

  <p>In the Latin <i>pater</i>, and in the English <i>father</i>, we have
  one of two things, either two words descended or derived from each other,
  or two words descended or derived from a common original source.</p>

  <p>In <i>fathers</i> we have a formation deduced from the radical word
  <i>father</i>.</p>

  <p>With these preliminaries we may understand Dr. Johnson's explanation
  of the word etymology.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON GENDER.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect180">§ 180</a>. How far is there such a thing as
  <i>gender</i> in the English language? This depends upon the meaning that
  we attach to the word.</p>

  <p>In the Latin language we have the words <i>taurus</i> = <i>bull</i>,
  and <i>vacca</i> = <i>cow</i>. Here the natural distinction of <i>sex</i>
  is expressed by <i>wholly</i> different words. With this we have
  corresponding modes of expression in English: <i>e.g.</i>,</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Male and female wholly different words." title="Male and female wholly different words.">
<tr><td class="spacsingle"><i>Male.</i></td><td class="rightbsing"><i>Female.</i></td><td class="spacsingle"><i>Male.</i></td><td class="spacsingle"><i>Female.</i></td></tr>

<tr><td class="spacsingle">Buck</td><td class="rightbsing">Doe.</td><td class="spacsingle">Father</td><td class="spacsingle">Mother, &amp;c.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The mode, however, of expressing different sexes by <i>wholly</i>
  different words is not a matter of <i>gender</i>. The words <i>boy</i>
  and <i>girl</i> bear no <i>etymological</i> relation to each other;
  neither being derived from the other, nor in any way connected with
  it.</p>

  <p><a name="sect181">§ 181</a>. Neither are words like
  <i>cock-sparrow</i>, <i>man-servant</i>, <i>he-goat</i>, &amp;c., as
  compared with <i>hen-sparrow</i>, <i>maid-servant</i>, <i>she-goat</i>,
  &amp;c., specimens of <i>gender</i>. Here a difference of sex is
  indicated by the addition of a fresh term, from which is formed a
  compound word.</p>

  <p><a name="sect182">§ 182</a>. In the Latin words <i>genitrix</i> = <i>a
  mother</i>, and <!-- Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page135"></a>[135]</span><i>genitor</i> = <i>a father</i>, we have
  a nearer approach to <i>gender</i>. Here the difference of sex is
  expressed by a difference of termination; the words <i>genitor</i> and
  <i>genitrix</i> being in a true etymological relation, <i>i.e.</i>,
  either derived from each other, or from some common source. With this we
  have, in English corresponding modes of expression: <i>e.g.</i></p>

  <p>Here the letters in italics, or the signs of the cases and numbers,
  are different; the difference being brought about by the difference of
  gender. Now it is very evident that, if <i>genitrix</i> be a specimen of
  gender, <i>domina</i> is something more.</p>

  <p><a name="sect185">§ 185</a>. It may be laid down as a sort of
  definition, that <i>there is no gender where there is no affection of the
  declension</i>: consequently, that, although we have, in English, words
  corresponding to <i>genitrix</i> and <i>genitor</i>, we have no true
  genders until we find words corresponding to <i>dominus</i> and
  <i>domina</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect186">§ 186</a>. The second element in the notion of
  gender, although I will not venture to call it an essential one, is the
  following:&mdash;In the words <i>domina</i> and <i>dominus</i>,
  <i>mistress</i> and <i>master</i>, there is a <i>natural</i> distinction
  of sex; the one being masculine, or male, the other feminine, or female.
  In the words <i>sword</i> and <i>lance</i> there is <i>no natural</i>
  distinction of sex. Notwithstanding this, the word <i>hasta</i>, in
  Latin, is as much of the feminine gender as <i>domina</i>, whilst
  <i>gladius</i> = <i>a sword</i> is, like <i>dominus</i>, a masculine
  noun. From this we see that, in languages wherein there are true genders,
  a fictitious or <!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page137"></a>[137]</span>conventional sex is attributed even to
  inanimate objects; in other words, <i>sex</i> is a natural distinction,
  <i>gender</i> a grammatical one.</p>

  <p><a name="sect187">§ 187</a>. In § <a href="#sect185">185</a> it is
  written, that "although we have, in English, words corresponding to
  <i>genitrix</i> and <i>genitor</i>, we have no true genders until we find
  <i>words corresponding to dominus</i> and <i>domina</i>."&mdash;The
  sentence was intentionally worded with caution. Words like <i>dominus</i>
  and <i>domina</i>, that is, words where the declension is affected by the
  sex, <i>are</i> to be found <i>even in English</i>.</p>

  <p>The pronoun <i>him</i>, from the Anglo-Saxon and English <i>he</i>, as
  compared with the pronoun <i>her</i>, from the Anglo-Saxon <i>heó</i>, is
  affected in its declension by the difference of sex, and is a true,
  though fragmentary, specimen of gender. The same is the case with the
  form <i>his</i> as compared with <i>her</i>.</p>

  <p>The pronoun <i>it</i> (originally <i>hit</i>), as compared with
  <i>he</i>, is a specimen of gender.</p>

  <p>The relative <i>what</i>, as compared with the masculine <i>who</i>,
  is a specimen of gender.</p>

  <p>The forms <i>it</i> (for <i>hit</i>) and <i>he</i> are as much genders
  as <i>hoc</i> and <i>hic</i>, and the forms <i>hoc</i> and <i>hic</i> are
  as much genders as <i>bonum</i> and <i>bonus</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect188">§ 188</a>. The formation of the neuter gender by the
  addition of <i>-t</i>, in words like <i>wha-t</i>, <i>i-t</i>, and
  <i>tha-t</i>, occurs in other languages. The <i>-t</i> in <i>tha-t</i> is
  the <i>-d</i> in <i>istu-d</i>, Latin, and the <i>-t</i> in <i>ta-t</i>,
  Sanskrit.</p>

  <p><a name="sect189">§ 189</a>. In the M&oelig;so-Gothic and
  Scandinavian, the <i>adjectives</i> form the neuters in <i>-t</i>, in Old
  High German in <i>-z</i> (<i>ts</i>), and in Modem German in <i>-s</i>
  (derived from <i>-z</i>)&mdash;M&oelig;so-Gothic, <i>blind-ata</i>;
  Icel., <i>blind-t</i>; Old High German, <i>plint-ez</i>, M. G.
  <i>blind-es</i> = <i>cæc-um</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Caution.</i>&mdash;<i>Which</i>, is <i>not</i> the neuter of
  <i>who</i>. <!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page138"></a>[138]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect190">§ 190</a>. Just as there are in English fragments of
  a gender modifying the declension, so are there, also, fragments of the
  second element of gender; <i>viz.</i>, the attribution of sex to objects
  naturally destitute of it. <i>The sun in </i>his<i> glory</i>, <i>the
  moon in </i>her<i> wane</i>, are examples of this. A sailor calls his
  ship <i>she</i>. A husbandman, according to Mr. Cobbett, does the same
  with his <i>plough</i> and working implements:&mdash;"In speaking of a
  <i>ship</i> we say <i>she</i> and <i>her</i>. And you know that our
  country-folks in Hampshire call almost every thing <i>he</i> or
  <i>she</i>. It is curious to observe that country labourers give the
  feminine appellation to those things only which are more closely
  identified with themselves, and by the qualities or conditions of which
  their own efforts, and their character as workmen, are affected. The
  mower calls his <i>scythe</i> a <i>she</i>, the ploughman calls his
  <i>plough</i> a <i>she</i>; but a prong, or a shovel, or a harrow, which
  passes promiscuously from hand to hand, and which is appropriated to no
  particular labourer, is called a <i>he</i>."&mdash;"English Grammar,"
  Letter v.</p>

  <p><a name="sect191">§ 191</a>. Now, although Mr. Cobbett's statements
  may account for a sailor calling his ship <i>she</i>, they will not
  account for the custom of giving to the sun a masculine, and to the moon
  a feminine, pronoun, as is done in the expressions quoted in the last
  section; still less will it account for the circumstance of the Germans
  reversing the gender, and making the <i>sun</i> feminine, and the
  <i>moon</i> masculine.</p>

  <p><a name="sect192">§ 192</a>. Let there be a period in the history of a
  language wherein the <i>sun</i> and <i>moon</i> are dealt with, not as
  inanimate masses of matter, but as animated divinities. Let there, in
  other words, be a time when dead things are personified, and when there
  is a <i>mythology</i>. Let an object like the <i>sun</i> be deemed a
  <i>male</i>, and an object like <!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page139"></a>[139]</span>the <i>moon</i>, a <i>female</i>, deity.
  We may then understand the origin of certain genders.</p>

  <p>The Germans say the <i>sun in </i>her<i> glory</i>; the <i>moon in
  </i>his<i> wane</i>. This difference between the usage of the two
  languages, like so many others, is explained by the influence of the
  classical languages upon the English.&mdash;"<i>Mundilfori had two
  children; a son, Mâni (Moon), and a daughter, Sôl (Sun).</i>"&mdash;Such
  is an extract out of an Icelandic mythological work, <i>viz.</i>, the
  prose Edda. In the classical languages, however, <i>Ph&oelig;bus</i> and
  <i>Sol</i> are masculine, and <i>Luna</i> and <i>Diana</i> feminine.
  Hence it is that, although in Anglo-Saxon and Old-Saxon the <i>sun</i> is
  <i>feminine</i>, it is in English <i>masculine</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Philosophy</i>, <i>charity</i>, &amp;c., or the names of abstract
  qualities personified, take a conventional sex, and are feminine from
  their being feminine in Latin.</p>

  <p>As in all these words there is no change of form, the consideration of
  them is a point of rhetoric, rather than of etymology.</p>

  <p><a name="sect193">§ 193</a>. The remainder of this chapter is devoted
  to miscellaneous remarks upon the true and apparent genders of the
  English language.</p>

  <p>1. With the false genders like <i>baron</i>, <i>baroness</i>, it is a
  general rule that the feminine form is derived from the masculine, and
  not the masculine from the feminine; as <i>peer</i>, <i>peeress</i>. The
  words <i>widower</i>, <i>gander</i>, and <i>drake</i> are exceptions. For
  the word <i>wizard</i>, from <i>witch</i>, see the section on
  augmentative forms.</p>

  <p>2. The termination <i>-ess</i>, in which so large a portion of our
  feminine substantives terminate, is not of Saxon but of classical origin,
  being derived from the termination <i>-ix</i>, <i>genitrix</i>.</p>

  <p>3. The words <i>shepherdess</i>, <i>huntress</i>, and <i>hostess</i>
  are faulty; the radical part of the word being Germanic, and <!-- Page
  140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>[140]</span>the
  secondary part classical: indeed, in strict English Grammar, the
  termination <i>-ess</i> has no place at all. It is a classic, not a
  Gothic, element.</p>

  <p>4. The termination <i>-inn</i>, is current in German, as the
  equivalent to <i>-ess</i>, and as a feminine affix (<i>freund</i> = <i>a
  friend</i>; <i>freundinn</i> = <i>a female friend</i>). In English it
  occurs only in a fragmentary form;&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, in <i>vixen</i>, a
  true feminine derivative from <i>fox</i> = <i>füchsinn</i>, German.</p>

  <p><i>Bruin</i> = <i>the bear</i>, may be either a female form, as in Old
  High German <i>përo</i> = <i>a he-bear</i>, <i>pirinn</i> = <i>a
  she-bear</i>; or it may be the Norse form <i>björn</i> = <i>a bear</i>,
  male or female.</p>

  <p><i>Caution.</i>&mdash;Words like <i>margravine</i> and
  <i>landgravine</i> prove nothing, being scarcely naturalised.</p>

  <p>5. The termination <i>-str</i>, as in <i>webster</i>, <i>songster</i>,
  and <i>baxter</i>, was originally a feminine affix. Thus, in
  Anglo-Saxon,</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Anglo-Saxon suffix -stre." title="Anglo-Saxon suffix -stre.">
<tr><td class="nspac">Sangere, <i>a male singer</i></td><td class="nspac" rowspan="6" valign="middle"><a href="images/$rbrace.png"><img src="images/$rbrace.png" class="middle" style="height:14ex; width:1em" alt="brace" /></a></td><td class="nspac" rowspan="6" valign="middle">&nbsp; were opposed to &nbsp;</td><td class="nspac" rowspan="6" valign="middle"><a href="images/$lbrace.png"><img src="images/$lbrace.png" class="middle" style="height:14ex; width:1em" alt="brace" /></a> &nbsp;</td><td class="nspac">Sangëstre, <i>a female singer</i>.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="nspac">Seamere, <i>a male seamer</i></td><td class="nspac">Seamestre, <i>a female seamer</i>.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The same is the case in the present Dutch of Holland: <i>e.g.</i>,
  <i>spookster</i> = <i>a female fortune-teller</i>; <i>baxster</i> = <i>a
  baking-woman</i>; <i>waschster</i> = <i>a washerwoman</i>. The word
  <i>spinster</i> still retains its original feminine force.</p>

  <p>6. The words <i>songstress</i> and <i>seamstress</i>, besides being,
  as far as concerns the intermixture of languages, in the predicament of
  <i>shepherdess</i>, have, moreover, a double feminine termination; 1st.
  <i>-str</i>, of Germanic, 2nd. <i>-ess</i>, of classical, origin.</p>

  <p>7. In the word <i>heroine</i> we have a Greek termination, just as
  <i>-ix</i> is a Latin, and <i>-inn</i> a German one. It must <!-- Page
  141 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>[141]</span>not,
  however, be considered as derived from <i>hero</i>, by any process of the
  English language, but be dealt with as a separate importation from the
  Greek language.</p>

  <p>8. The form <i>deaconness</i> is not wholly unexceptionable; since the
  termination <i>-ess</i> is of Latin, the root <i>deacon</i> of Greek
  origin: this Greek origin being rendered all the more conspicuous by the
  spelling, <i>deacon</i> (from <i>diaconos</i>), as compared with the
  Latin <i>decanus</i>.</p>

  <p>9. <i>Goose, gander</i>.&mdash;One peculiarity in this pair of words
  has already been indicated. In the older forms of the word <i>goose</i>,
  such as <span title="chên" class="grk">&chi;&#x1F74;&nu;</span>, Greek;
  <i>anser</i>, Latin; <i>gans</i>, German, as well as in the derived form
  <i>gander</i>, we have the proofs that, originally, there belonged to the
  word the sound of the letter <i>n</i>. In the forms <span title="odous" class="grk"
  >&#x1F40;&delta;&omicron;&#x1F7A;&sigmaf;</span>, <span title="odontos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F40;&delta;&#x1F79;&nu;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, Greek;
  <i>dens</i>, <i>dentis</i>, Latin; <i>zahn</i>, German; <i>tooth</i>,
  English, we find the analogy that accounts for the ejection of the
  <i>n</i>, and the lengthening of the vowel preceding. With respect,
  however, to the <i>d</i> in <i>gander</i>, it is not easy to say whether
  it is inserted in one word or omitted in the other. Neither can we give
  the precise power of the <i>-er</i>. The following forms occur in the
  different Gothic dialects. <i>Gans</i>, fem.; <i>ganazzo</i>, masc., Old
  High German&mdash;<i>gôs</i>, f.; <i>gandra</i>, m.,
  Anglo-Saxon&mdash;<i>gâs</i>, Icelandic, f.; <i>gaas</i>, Danish, f.;
  <i>gassi</i>, Icelandic, m.; <i>gasse</i>, Danish,
  m.&mdash;<i>ganser</i>, <i>ganserer</i>, <i>gansart</i>,
  <i>gänserich</i>, <i>gander</i>, masculine forms in different New German
  dialects.</p>

  <p>10. Observe, the form <i>gänserich</i>, has a masculine termination.
  The word <i>täuberich</i>, in provincial New German, has the same form
  and the same power. It denotes a <i>male dove</i>; <i>taube</i>, in
  German, signifying a <i>dove</i>. In <i>gänserich</i> and
  <i>täuberich</i>, we find preserved the termination <i>-rich</i> (or
  <i>rik</i>), with a masculine power. Of this termination we have a
  remnant, in English, preserved in the curious word <i>drake</i>. To
  <i>duck</i> the word <i>drake</i> has no <!-- Page 142 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>[142]</span>etymological relation
  whatsoever. It is derived from a word with which it has but one letter in
  common; <i>viz.</i>, the Latin <i>anas</i> = <i>a duck</i>. Of this the
  root is <i>anat-</i>, as seen in the genitive case <i>anatis</i>. In Old
  High German we find the form <i>anetrekho</i> = <i>a drake</i>; in
  provincial New High German there is <i>enterich</i> and <i>äntrecht</i>,
  from whence come the English and Low German form, <i>drake</i>.</p>

  <p>11. <i>Peacock</i>, <i>peahen</i>.&mdash;In these compounds, it is not
  the word <i>pea</i> that is rendered masculine or feminine by the
  addition of <i>cock</i> and <i>hen</i>, but it is the words <i>cock</i>
  and <i>hen</i> that are modified by prefixing <i>pea</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE NUMBERS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect194">§ 194</a>. In the Greek language the word
  <i>patær</i> signifies a <i>father</i>, denoting <i>one</i>, whilst
  <i>patere</i> signifies <i>two fathers</i>, denoting a pair, and thirdly,
  <i>pateres</i> signifies <i>fathers</i>, speaking of any number beyond
  two. The three words, <i>patær</i>, <i>patere</i>, and <i>pateres</i>,
  are said to be in different numbers, the difference of meaning being
  expressed by a difference of form. These numbers have names. The number
  that speaks of <i>one</i> is the <i>singular</i>, the number that speaks
  of <i>two</i> is the <i>dual</i> (from the Latin word <i>duo</i> =
  <i>two</i>), and the number that speaks of <i>more than two</i> is the
  <i>plural</i>.</p>

  <p>All languages have numbers, but all languages have not them to the
  same extent. The Hebrew has a dual, but it is restricted to nouns only.
  It has, moreover, this peculiarity; it applies, for the most part, only
  to things which are naturally double, as <i>the two eyes</i>, <i>the two
  hands</i>, &amp;c. The Latin has no dual number, except the
  <i>natural</i> one in the words <i>ambo</i> and <i>duo</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect195">§ 195</a>. The question presents itself,&mdash;to
  what extent have we numbers in English? Like the Greek, Hebrew, and
  Latin, we have a singular and a plural. Like the Latin, and unlike the
  Greek and Hebrew, we have no dual.</p>

  <p><a name="sect196">§ 196</a>. Different from the question, <i>to what
  degree have we numbers?</i> is the question,&mdash;<i>over what extent of
  <!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page144"></a>[144]</span>our language have we numbers?</i> This
  distinction has already been foreshadowed or indicated. The Greeks, who
  said <i>typtô</i> = <i>I beat</i>, <i>typteton</i> = <i>ye two beat</i>,
  <i>typtomen</i> = <i>we beat</i>, had a dual number for their verbs as
  well as their nouns; while the Hebrew dual was limited to the nouns only.
  In the Greek, then, the dual number is spread over a greater extent of
  the language than in the Hebrew.</p>

  <p>There is no dual in the <i>present</i> English. It has been seen,
  however, that in the Anglo-Saxon there <i>was</i> a dual. But the
  Anglo-Saxon dual, being restricted to the personal pronouns (<i>wit</i> =
  <i>we two</i>; <i>git</i> = <i>ye two</i>), was not co-extensive with the
  Greek dual.</p>

  <p>There is no dual in the present German. In the ancient German there
  <i>was</i> one.</p>

  <p>In the present Danish and Swedish there is no dual. In the Old Norse
  and in the present Icelandic a dual number is to be found.</p>

  <p>From this we learn that the dual number is one of those inflections
  that languages drop as they become modern.</p>

  <p><a name="sect197">§ 197</a>. The numbers, then, in the present English
  are two, the singular and the plural. Over what extent of language have
  we a plural? The Latins say <i>bonus pater</i> = <i>a good father</i>;
  <i>boni patres</i> = <i>good fathers</i>. In the Latin, the adjective
  <i>bonus</i> changes its form with the change of number of the
  substantive that it accompanies. In English it is only the substantive
  that is changed. Hence we see that in the Latin language the numbers were
  extended to adjectives, whereas in English they are confined to the
  substantives and pronouns. Compared with the Anglo-Saxon, the present
  English is in the same relation as it is with the Latin. In the
  Anglo-Saxon there were plural forms for the adjectives. <!-- Page 145
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>[145]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect198">§ 198</a>. Respecting the formation of the plural,
  the current rule is, that it is formed from the singular by adding
  <i>s</i>, as <i>father</i>, <i>fathers</i>. This, however, is by no means
  a true expression. The letter <i>s</i> added to the word <i>father</i>,
  making it <i>fathers</i>, is <i>s</i> to the <i>eye</i> only. To the
  <i>ear</i> it is <i>z</i>. The word sounds <i>fatherz</i>. If the
  <i>s</i> retained its sound the spelling would be <i>fatherce</i>. In
  <i>stags</i>, <i>lads</i>, &amp;c., the sound is <i>stagz</i>,
  <i>ladz</i>. The rule, then, for the formation of the English plurals,
  rigorously, though somewhat lengthily expressed, is as
  follows.&mdash;<i>The plural is formed from the singular, by adding to
  words ending in a vowel, a liquid or flat mute, the flat lene sibilant
  (z); and to words ending in a sharp mute, the sharp lene sibilant
  (s):</i> <i>e.g.</i> (the sound of the word being expressed), <i>pea</i>,
  <i>peaz</i>; <i>tree</i>, <i>treez</i>; <i>day</i>, <i>dayz</i>;
  <i>hill</i>, <i>hillz</i>; <i>hen</i>, <i>henz</i>; <i>gig</i>,
  <i>gigz</i>; <i>trap</i>, <i>traps</i>; <i>pit</i>, <i>pits</i>;
  <i>stack</i>, <i>stacks</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect199">§ 199</a>. Upon the formation of the English plural
  some further remarks are necessary.</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> In the case of words ending in <i>b</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>d</i>,
  the <i>th</i> in <i>thine</i> = <i>ð</i>, or <i>g</i>, a change either of
  the final flat consonant, or of the sharp <i>s</i> affixed, was <i>not a
  matter of choice but of necessity</i>; the combinations <i>abs</i>,
  <i>avs</i>, <i>ads</i>, <i>aðs</i>, <i>ags</i>, being
  unpronounceable.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> Whether the first of the two mutes should be accommodated to
  the second (<i>aps</i>, <i>afs</i>, <i>ats</i>, <i>aþs</i>, <i>aks</i>),
  or the second to the first (<i>abz</i>, <i>avz</i>, <i>adz</i>,
  <i>aðz</i>, <i>agz</i>), is determined by <i>the habit of the particular
  language</i> in question; and, with a few <i>apparent</i> exceptions it
  is the rule of the English language to accommodate the second sound to
  the first, and not <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

  <p><i>c.</i> Such combinations as <i>peas</i>, <i>trees</i>,
  <i>hills</i>, <i>hens</i>, &amp;c., (the <i>s</i> preserving its original
  power, and being sounded as <span class="correction" title="Original reads `is'."
  >if</span> written <i>peace</i>, <i>treece</i>, <i>hillce</i>,
  <i>hence</i>), being pronounceable, the change from <i>s</i> to <i>z</i>,
  in words so ending, is <i>not</i> a <!-- Page 146 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>[146]</span>matter determined by
  the necessity of the case, but by the habit of the English language.</p>

  <p><i>d.</i> Although the vast majority of our plurals ends, not in
  <i>s</i>, but in <i>z</i>, the original addition was not <i>z</i>, but
  <i>s</i>. This we infer from three facts: 1. From the spelling; 2. from
  the fact of the sound of <i>z</i> being either rare or non-existent in
  Anglo-Saxon; 3. from the sufficiency of the causes to bring about the
  change.</p>

  <p>It may now be seen that some slight variations in the form of our
  plurals are either mere points of orthography, or else capable of being
  explained on very simple euphonic principles.</p>

  <p><a name="sect200">§ 200</a>. <i>Boxes, churches, judges, lashes,
  kisses, blazes, princes</i>.&mdash;Here there is the addition, not of the
  mere letter <i>s</i>, but of the syllable <i>-es</i>. As <i>s</i> cannot
  be immediately added to <i>s</i>, the intervention of a vowel becomes
  necessary; and that all the words whose plural is formed in <i>-es</i>
  really end either in the sounds of <i>s</i>, or in the allied sounds of
  <i>z</i>, <i>sh</i>, or <i>zh</i>, may be seen by analysis; since
  <i>x</i> = <i>ks</i>, <i>ch</i> = <i>tsh</i>, and <i>j</i> or <i>ge</i> =
  <i>dzh</i>, whilst <i>ce</i>, in <i>prince</i>, is a mere point of
  orthography for <i>s</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Monarchs</i>, <i>heresiarchs</i>.&mdash;Here the <i>ch</i> equals
  not <i>tsh</i>, but <i>k</i>, so that there is no need of being told that
  they do not follow the analogy of <i>church</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Cargoes</i>, <i>echoes</i>.&mdash;From <i>cargo</i> and
  <i>echo</i>, with the addition of <i>e</i>; an orthographical expedient
  for the sake of denoting the length of the vowel <i>o</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Beauty, beauties</i>; <i>key, keys</i>.&mdash;Like the word
  <i>cargoes</i>, &amp;c., these forms are points, not of etymology, but of
  orthography.</p>

  <p><i>Pence</i>.&mdash;The peculiarity of this word consists in having a
  <i>flat</i> liquid followed by the sharp sibilant <i>s</i> (spelt
  <i>ce</i>), contrary to the rule given above. In the first place, it is a
  contracted form from <i>pennies</i>; in the second place, its <!-- Page
  147 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>[147]</span>sense is
  collective rather than plural; in the third place, the use of the sharp
  sibilant lene distinguishes it from <i>pens</i>, sounded <i>penz</i>.
  That its sense is <i>collective</i> rather than <i>plural</i>, we learn
  from the word <i>sixpence</i>, which, compared with <i>sixpences</i>, is
  no plural, but a singular form.</p>

  <p><i>Dice</i>.&mdash;In respect to its form, peculiar for the reason
  that <i>pence</i> is peculiar.&mdash;We find the sound of <i>s</i> after
  a vowel, where that of <i>z</i> is expected. This distinguishes
  <i>dice</i> for play, from <i>dies</i> (<i>diz</i>) for coining.
  <i>Dice</i>, perhaps, like <i>pence</i>, is collective rather than
  plural.</p>

  <p>In <i>geese</i>, <i>lice</i>, and <i>mice</i>, we have, apparently,
  the same phenomenon as in <i>dice</i>, <i>viz.</i>, a sharp sibilant
  (<i>s</i>) where a <i>flat</i> one (<i>z</i>) is expected. The <i>s</i>,
  however, in these words is not the sign of the plural, but the last
  letter of the original word.</p>

  <p><i>Alms</i>.&mdash;This is no true plural form. The <i>s</i> belongs
  to the original word, Anglo-Saxon, <i>ælmesse</i>; Greek, <span
  title="eleêmosunê" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&lambda;&epsilon;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&sigma;&#x1F7B;&nu;&eta;</span>;
  just as the <i>s</i> in <i>goose</i> does. How far the word, although a
  true singular in its form, may have a collective signification, and
  require its verb to be plural, is a point not of etymology, but of
  syntax. The same is the case with the word <i>riches</i>, from the French
  <i>richesse</i>. In <i>riches</i> the last syllable being sounded as
  <i>ez</i>, increases its liability to pass for a plural.</p>

  <p><i>News</i>, <i>means</i>, <i>pains</i>.&mdash;These, the reverse of
  <i>alms</i> and <i>riches</i>, are true plural forms. How far, in sense,
  they are singular is a point not of etymology, but of syntax.</p>

  <p><i>Mathematics</i>, <i>metaphysics</i>, <i>politics</i>,
  <i>ethics</i>, <i>optics</i>, <i>physics</i>.&mdash;The following is an
  exhibition of my hypothesis respecting these words, to which I invite the
  reader's criticism. All the words in point are of Greek origin, and all
  are derived from a Greek adjective. Each is the name of some department
  of study, of some art, or <!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page148"></a>[148]</span>of some science. As the words are Greek,
  so also are the sciences which they denote, either of Greek origin, or
  else such as flourished in Greece. Let the arts and sciences of Greece be
  expressed in Greek, rather by a substantive and an adjective combined,
  than by a simple substantive; for instance, let it be the habit of the
  language to say <i>the musical art</i>, rather than <i>music</i>. Let the
  Greek for <i>art</i> be a word in the feminine gender; <i>e.g.</i>, <span
  title="technê" class="grk">&tau;&#x1F73;&chi;&nu;&eta;</span>
  (<i>tekhnæ</i>), so that the <i>musical art</i> be <span title="hê mousikê technê" class="grk"
  >&#x1F21; &mu;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;&#x1F77;&kappa;&eta;
  &tau;&#x1F73;&chi;&nu;&eta;</span> (<i>hæ mousikæ tekhnæ</i>). Let, in
  the progress of language (as was actually the case in Greece), the
  article and substantive be omitted, so that, for the <i>musical art</i>,
  or for <i>music</i>, there stand only the feminine adjective, <span
  title="mousikê" class="grk"
  >&mu;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;&#x1F77;&kappa;&eta;</span>. Let there be,
  upon a given art or science, a series of books, or treatises; the Greek
  for <i>book</i>, or <i>treatise</i>, being a neuter substantive, <span
  title="biblion" class="grk"
  >&beta;&#x1F77;&beta;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</span> (<i>biblion</i>).
  Let the substantive meaning <i>treatise</i> be, in the course of
  language, omitted, so that whilst the science of physics is called <span
  title="phusikê" class="grk"
  >&phi;&upsilon;&sigma;&#x1F77;&kappa;&eta;</span> (<i>fysikæ</i>),
  physic, from <span title="hê phusikê technê" class="grk">&#x1F21;
  &phi;&upsilon;&sigma;&#x1F77;&kappa;&eta;
  &tau;&#x1F73;&chi;&nu;&eta;</span>, a series of treatises (or even
  chapters) upon the science shall be called <span title="phusika" class="grk"
  >&phi;&#x1F7B;&sigma;&iota;&kappa;&alpha;</span> (<i>fysika</i>) or
  physics. Now all this was what happened in Greece. The science was
  denoted by a feminine adjective singular, as <span title="phusikê" class="grk"
  >&phi;&upsilon;&sigma;&#x1F77;&kappa;&eta;</span> (<i>fysicæ</i>), and
  the treatises upon it, by the neuter adjective plural, as <span
  title="phusika" class="grk"
  >&phi;&#x1F7B;&sigma;&iota;&kappa;&alpha;</span> (<i>fysika</i>). The
  treatises of Aristotle are generally so named. To apply this, I conceive,
  that in the middle ages a science of Greek origin might have its name
  drawn from two sources, <i>viz.</i>, from the name of the art or science,
  or from the name of the books wherein it was treated. In the first case
  it had a singular form, as <i>physic</i>, <i>logic</i>; in the second
  place a plural form, as <i>mathematics</i>, <i>metaphysics</i>,
  <i>optics</i>.</p>

  <p>In what number these words, having a collective sense, require their
  verbs to be, is a point of syntax. <!-- Page 149 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>[149]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect201">§ 201</a>. The plural form <i>children</i>
  (<i>child-er-en</i>) requires particular notice.</p>

  <p>In the first place it is a double plural; the <i>-en</i> being the
  <i>-en</i> in <i>oxen</i>, whilst the simpler form <i>child-er</i> occurs
  in the old English, and in certain provincial dialects.</p>

  <p>Now, what is the <i>-er</i> in <i>child-er</i>?</p>

  <p>In Icelandic, no plural termination is commoner than that in
  <i>-r</i>; as <i>geisl-ar</i> = <i>flashes</i>, <i>tung-ur</i> =
  <i>tongues</i>, &amp;c. Nevertheless, it is not the Icelandic that
  explains the plural form in question.</p>

  <p>Besides the word <i>childer</i>, we collect from the Old High German
  the following forms in <i>-r</i>:&mdash;</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Old High German plurals in -r." title="Old High German plurals in -r.">
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Hus-ir,</td><td class="spacsingle"><i>Houses</i>,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Chalp-ir,</td><td class="spacsingle"><i>Calves</i>,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Lemp-ir,</td><td class="spacsingle"><i>Lambs</i>,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Plet-ir,</td><td class="spacsingle"><i>Blades of grass</i>,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Eig-ir,</td><td class="spacsingle"><i>Eggs</i>,</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>and others, the peculiarity of which is the fact of their all being
  <i>of the neuter gender</i>.</p>

  <p>Now, the theory respecting this form which is propounded by Grimm is
  as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The <i>-r</i> represents an earlier <i>-s</i>.</p>

  <p>2. Which was, originally, no sign of a plural number, but merely a
  neuter derivative affix, common to the singular as well as to the plural
  number.</p>

  <p>3. In this form it appears in the M&oelig;so-Gothic: <i>ag-is</i> =
  <i>fear</i> (whence <i>ague</i> = <i>shivering</i>), <i>hat-is</i> =
  <i>hate</i>, <i>riqv-is</i> = <i>smoke</i> (<i>reek</i>). In none of
  these words is the <i>-s</i> radical, and in none is it limited to the
  singular number.</p>

  <p>To these doctrines, it should be added, that the reason why a singular
  derivational affix should become the sign of the plural number, lies,
  most probably, in the <i>collective</i> nature of the words in which it
  occurs: <i>Husir</i> = <i>a collection of houses</i>, <i>eiger</i> = <i>a
  collection of eggs</i>, <i>eggery</i> <!-- Page 150 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page150"></a>[150]</span>or <i>eyry</i>. In
  words like <i>yeoman-r-y</i> and <i>Jew-r-y</i>, the <i>-r</i> has,
  probably, the same origin, and is <i>collective</i>.</p>

  <p>In Wicliffe we find the form <i>lamb-r-en</i>, which is to <i>lamb</i>
  as <i>children</i> is to <i>child</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect202">§ 202</a>. <i>The form in -en.</i>&mdash;In the
  Anglo-Saxon no termination of the plural number is more common than
  <i>-n</i>: <i>tungan</i>, tongues; <i>steorran</i>, stars. Of this
  termination we have evident remains in the words <i>oxen</i>,
  <i>hosen</i>, <i>shoon</i>, <i>eyne</i>, words more or less antiquated.
  This, perhaps, is <i>no</i> true plural. In <i>welk-in</i> = <i>the
  clouds</i>, the original singular form is lost.</p>

  <p><a name="sect203">§ 203</a>. <i>Men</i>, <i>feet</i>, <i>teeth</i>,
  <i>mice</i>, <i>lice</i>, <i>geese</i>.&mdash;In these we have some of
  the oldest words in the language. If these were, to a certainty, true
  plurals, we should have an appearance somewhat corresponding to the
  so-called <i>weak</i> and <i>strong</i> tenses of verbs; <i>viz.</i>, one
  series of plurals formed by a change of the vowel, and another by the
  addition of the sibilant. The word <i>kye</i>, used in Scotland for
  <i>cows</i>, is of the same class. The list in Anglo-Saxon of words of
  this kind is different from that of the present English.</p>

  <p><a name="sect204">§ 204</a>. <i>Brethren</i>.&mdash;Here there are two
  changes. 1. The alteration of the vowel. 2. The addition of <i>-en</i>.
  Mr. Guest quotes the forms <i>brethre</i> and <i>brothre</i> from the Old
  English. The sense is collective rather than plural.</p>

  <p><i>Peasen</i> = <i>pulse</i>.&mdash;As <i>children</i> is a double
  form of one <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page151"></a>[151]</span>sort (<i>r</i> + <i>en</i>), so is
  <i>peasen</i> a double form of another (<i>s</i> + <i>en</i>);
  <i>pea</i>, <i>pea-s</i>, <i>pea-s-en</i>. Wallis speaks to the
  <i>singular</i> power of the form in <i>-s</i>;&mdash;"Dicunt nonnulli
  <i>a pease</i>, pluraliter <i>peasen</i>; at melius, singulariter <i>a
  pea</i>, pluraliter <i>pease</i>."&mdash;P. 77. He might have added,
  that, theoretically, <i>pease</i> was the proper singular form; as shown
  by the Latin <i>pis-um</i>.</p>

  <p>If this were a plural form, it would be a very anomalous one. The
  <i>-en</i>, however, is no more a sign of the plural than is the

  <i>-ain</i> or <i>-eyn</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Chickens</i>.&mdash;A third variety of the double inflection
  (<i>en</i> + <i>s</i>), with the additional peculiarity of the form
  <i>chicken</i> being used, at present, almost exclusively in the singular
  number, although, originally, it was, probably, the plural of
  <i>chick</i>. So Wallis considered it:&mdash;"At olim etiam per
  <i>-en</i> vel <i>-yn</i> formabant pluralia; quorum pauca admodum adhuc
  retinemus. Ut, <i>an ox</i>, <i>a chick</i>, pluralitur <i>oxen</i>,
  <i>chicken</i> (sunt qui dicunt in singulari <i>chicken</i>, et in
  plurali <i>chickens</i>)." <i>Chick</i>, <i>chick-en</i>,
  <i>chick-en-s</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Fern</i>.&mdash;According to Wallis the <i>-n</i> in <i>fer-n</i>
  is the <i>-en</i> in <i>oxen</i>, in other words a plural
  termination:&mdash;"A <i>fere</i> (<i>filix</i>) pluraliter <i>fern</i>
  (verum nunc plerumque <i>fern</i> utroque numero dicitur, sed et in
  plurali <i>ferns</i>); nam <i>fere</i> et <i>feres</i> prope obsoleta
  sunt." Subject to this view, the word <i>fer-n-s</i> would exhibit the
  same phenomenon as the word <!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page152"></a>[152]</span><i>chicken-s</i>. It is doubtful, however,
  whether Wallis's view be correct. A reason for believing the <i>-n</i> to
  be radical is presented by the Anglo-Saxon form <i>fearn</i>, and the Old
  High German, <i>varam</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Women</i>.&mdash;Pronounced <i>wimmen</i>, as opposed to the
  singular form <i>w</i>oo<i>mman</i>. Probably an instance of
  accommodation.</p>

  <p><i>Houses</i>.&mdash;Pronounced <i>houz-ez</i>. The same peculiarity
  in the case of <i>s</i> and <i>z</i>, as occurs between <i>f</i> and
  <i>v</i> in words like <i>life</i>, <i>lives</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Paths</i>, <i>youths</i>.&mdash;Pronounced <i>padhz</i>,
  <i>yoodhz</i>. The same peculiarity in the case of <i>þ</i> and <i>ð</i>,
  as occurs between <i>s</i> and <i>z</i> in the words <i>house</i>,
  <i>houses</i>. "Finita in <i>f</i> plerumque alleviantur in plurali
  numero, substituendo <i>v</i>; ut <i>wife</i>, <i>wives</i>, &amp;c.
  Eademque alleviatio est etiam in <i>s</i> et <i>th</i>, quamvis retento
  charactere, in <i>house</i>, <i>cloth</i>, <i>path</i>."</p>

  <p><a name="sect205">§ 205</a>. The words sounded <i>houz-ez</i>,
  <i>padh-z</i>, <i>yoodh-z</i>, taken along with the extract from Wallis,
  lead us to an important class of words.&mdash;§ <a
  href="#sect199">199</a> <i>b</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect206">§ 206</a>. Certain words ending in <i>f</i>, like
  <i>loaf</i>, <i>wife</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The regular plural of these would be <i>loafs</i>, <i>wifes</i>,
  pronounced <i>loafce</i>, <i>wifce</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>But this is not the case. The sound added to the final <i>f</i> is the
  sound of <i>z</i>, not that of <i>s</i>.</p>

  <p>And the plurals are sounded <i>loavz</i>, <i>wivz</i> (<i>wivez</i>,
  <i>weivz</i>).</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the sound of the final <i>f</i> is changed to that of
  <i>v</i>; in other words, the <i>first</i> of the two letters is
  accommodated to the second, in violation to the rule of § <a
  href="#sect199">199</a> <i>b</i>.</p>

  <p>Can this be explained? Perhaps it can. In the Swedish language the
  letter <i>f</i> has the sound of <i>v</i>; so that <i>staf</i> is sounded
  <i>stav</i>.</p>

  <p>Again, in the allied languages the words in question <!-- Page 153
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>[153]</span>end in the
  <i>flat</i> (not the <i>sharp</i>) mute,&mdash;<i>weib</i>, <i>laub</i>,
  <i>calb</i>, <i>halb</i>, <i>stab</i>, &amp;c. = <i>wife</i>,
  <i>leaf</i>, <i>calf</i>, <i>half</i>, <i>staff</i>.</p>

  <p>This makes it probable that, originally, the <i>f</i> in <i>wife</i>,
  <i>loaf</i>, &amp;c. was sounded as <i>v</i>; so that the singular forms
  were <i>wive</i>, <i>loav</i>.</p>

  <p>If so, the <i>plural is</i> perfectly normal; it being the
  <i>singular</i> form on which the irregularity lies.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE CASES.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect207">§ 207</a>. The extent to which there are, in the
  English language, cases, depends on the meaning which we attach to the
  word case. In the term <i>a house of a father</i>, the idea expressed by
  the words <i>of a father</i>, is an idea of relation between them and the
  word <i>house</i>. This idea is an idea of property or possession. The
  relation between the words <i>father</i> and <i>house</i> may be called
  the <i>possessive</i> relation. This relation, or connexion, between the
  two words, is expressed by the preposition <i>of</i>.</p>

  <p>In the term <i>a father's house</i>, the idea is, there or
  thereabouts, the same; the relation or connexion between the two words
  being the same. The expression, however, differs. In <i>a father's
  house</i> the relation, or connexion, is expressed, not by a preposition,
  but by a change of form, <i>father</i> becoming <i>father's</i>.</p>

  <p><i>He gave the house to a father</i>.&mdash;Here the words
  <i>father</i> and <i>house</i> stand in another sort of relationship, the
  relationship being expressed by the preposition <i>to</i>. The idea <i>to
  a father</i> differs from the idea <i>of a father</i>, in being expressed
  in one way only; <i>viz.</i>, by the preposition. There is no second mode
  of expressing it by a change of form, as was done with
  <i>father's</i>.</p>

  <p><i>The father taught the child</i>.&mdash;Here there is neither
  preposition nor change of form. The connexion between <!-- Page 155
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>[155]</span>the words
  <i>father</i> and <i>child</i> is expressed by the arrangement only.</p>

  <p><a name="sect208">§ 208</a>. Now if the relation alone between two
  words constitute a case, the words <i>a child</i>, <i>to a father</i>,
  <i>of a father</i>, and <i>father's</i>, are all equally cases; of which
  one may be called the accusative, another the dative, a third the
  genitive, and so on.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, however, the relationship alone does not constitute a case.
  Perhaps there is a necessity of either the addition of a preposition (as
  in <i>of a father</i>), or of a change in form (as in <i>father's</i>).
  In this case (although <i>child</i> be not so) <i>father's</i>, <i>of a
  father</i>, and <i>to a father</i>, are all equally cases.</p>

  <p>Now it has long been remarked, that if the use of a preposition
  constitute a case, there must be as many cases in a language as there are
  prepositions, and that "<i>above a man</i>, <i>beneath a man</i>,
  <i>beyond a man</i>, <i>round about a man</i>, <i>within a man</i>,
  <i>without a man</i>, shall be cases as well as <i>of a man</i>, <i>to a
  man</i>, and <i>with a man</i>."</p>

  <p><a name="sect209">§ 209</a>. For etymological purposes, therefore, it
  is necessary to limit the meaning of the word case; and, as a sort of
  definition, it may be laid down that <i>where there is no change of form
  there is no case</i>. With this remark, the English language may be
  compared with the Latin.</p>

</table>

  <p>Here, since in the Latin language there are five changes of form,
  whilst in English there are but <i>two</i>, there are (as far, at least,
  as the word <i>pater</i> and <i>father</i> <!-- Page 156 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>[156]</span>are concerned) three
  more cases in Latin than in English.</p>

  <p>It does not, however, follow that because in the particular word
  <i>father</i> we have but two cases, there may not be other words wherein
  there are more than two.</p>

  <p><a name="sect210">§ 210</a>. Neither does it follow, that because two
  words may have the <i>same form</i> they are necessarily in the <i>same
  case</i>; a remark which leads to the distinction between <i>a real and
  an accidental identity of form</i>.</p>

  <p>In the language of the Anglo-Saxons the genitive cases of the words
  <i>smið</i>, <i>ende</i>, and <i>dæg</i>, were respectively,
  <i>smiðes</i>, <i>endes</i>, and <i>dæges</i>; whilst the nominative
  plurals were, <i>smiðas</i>, <i>endas</i>, and <i>dægas</i>.</p>

  <p>But when a change took place, by which the vowel of the last syllable
  in each word was ejected, the result was, that the forms of the genitive
  singular and the nominative plural, originally different, became one and
  the same; so that the identity of the two cases is an accident.</p>

  <p>This fact relieves the English grammarian from a difficulty. The
  nominative plural and the genitive singular are, in the present language
  of England, identical; the apostrophe in <i>father's</i> being a mere
  matter of orthography. However, there was <i>once</i> a difference. This
  modifies the previous statement, which may now stand thus:&mdash;<i>for a
  change of case there must be a change of form existing or
  presumed</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect211">§ 211</a>. <i>The number of our cases and the extent
  of language over which they spread.</i>&mdash;In the English language
  there is undoubtedly a <i>nominative</i> case. This occurs in
  substantives, adjectives, and pronouns (<i>father</i>, <i>good</i>,
  <i>he</i>) equally. It is found in both numbers.</p>

  <p><a name="sect212">§ 212</a>. <i>Accusative.</i>&mdash;Some call this
  the <i>objective</i> case. The words <i>him</i> and <i>them</i> (whatever
  they may have been <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page157"></a>[157]</span>originally) are now (to a certain extent)
  true accusatives. The accusative case is found in pronouns only. <i>Thee,
  me, us</i>, and <i>you</i> are, to a certain extent, true accusatives.
  These are accusative thus far: 1. They are not derived from any other
  case. 2. They are distinguished from the forms <i>I</i>, <i>my</i>,
  &amp;c. 3. Their meaning is accusative. Nevertheless, they are only
  imperfect accusatives. They have no sign of case, and are distinguished
  by negative characters only.</p>

  <p>One word in the present English is probably a true accusative in the
  strict sense of the term, <i>viz.</i>, the word <i>twain</i> =
  <i>two</i>. The <i>-n</i> in <i>twai-n</i> is the <i>-n</i> in
  <i>hine</i> = <i>him</i> and <i>hwone</i> = <i>whom</i>. This we see from
  the following inflection:&mdash;</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Cases in Latin and English." title="Cases in Latin and English.">

</table>

  <p>Although nominative as well as accusative, I have little doubt as to
  the original character of <i>twégen</i> being accusative. The <i>-n</i>
  is by no means radical; besides which, it <i>is</i> the sign of an
  accusative case, and is <i>not</i> the sign of a nominative.</p>

  <p><a name="sect213">§ 213</a>. <i>Dative.</i>&mdash;In the antiquated
  word <i>whilom</i> (<i>at times</i>), we have a remnant of the old dative
  in <i>-m</i>. The <i>sense</i> of the word is abverbial; its form,
  however, is that of a dative case.</p>

  <p><a name="sect214">§ 214</a>. <i>Genitive.</i>&mdash;Some call this the
  possessive case. It is found in substantives and pronouns (<i>father's,
  his</i>), but not in adjectives. It is formed like the nominative plural,
  by the addition of the lene sibilant (<i>father, fathers; buck,
  bucks</i>); or if the word end in <i>-s</i>, by that of <i>-es</i>
  (<i>boxes</i>, <i>judges</i>, &amp;c.) It is found in both numbers: <!--
  Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page158"></a>[158]</span><i>the men's hearts</i>; <i>the children's
  bread</i>. In the plural number, however, it is rare; so rare, indeed,
  that wherever the plural ends in <i>s</i> (as it almost always does),
  there is no genitive. If it were not so, we should have such words as
  <i>fatherses</i>, <i>foxeses</i>, <i>princeses</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><a name="sect215">§ 215</a>. <i>Instrumental.</i>&mdash;The following
  extracts from Rask's "Anglo-Saxon Grammar," teach us that there exist in
  the present English two powers of the word spelt <i>t-h-e</i>, or of the
  so-called definite article&mdash;"The demonstrative pronouns are <i>þæt,
  se, seó</i> (<i>id, is, ea</i>), which are also used for the article; and

  <p>Hence the <i>the</i> that has originated out of the Anglo-Saxon
  <i>þý</i> is one word; whilst the <i>the</i> that has originated <!--
  Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>[159]</span>out
  of the Anglo-Saxon <i>þe</i>, another. The latter is the common article:
  the former the <i>the</i> in expressions like <i>all the more</i>, <i>all
  the better</i> = <i>more by all that</i>, <i>better by all that</i>, and
  the Latin phrases <i>eo majus</i>, <i>eo melius</i>.</p>

  <p>That <i>why</i> is in the same case with the instrumental <i>the</i> (
  = <i>þý</i>) may be seen from the following Anglo-Saxon inflexion of the
  interrogative pronoun:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Hence, then, in <i>the</i> and <i>why</i> we have instrumental
  ablatives, or, simply, <i>instrumentals</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect216">§ 216</a>. <i>The determination of
  cases.</i>&mdash;How do we determine cases? In other words, why do we
  call <i>him</i> and <i>them</i> accusatives rather than datives or
  genitives? By one of two means; <i>viz.</i>, either by the <i>sense</i>
  or the <i>form</i>.</p>

  <p>Suppose that in the English language there were ten thousand dative
  cases and as many accusatives. Suppose, also, that all the dative cases
  ended in <i>-m</i>, and all the accusatives in some other letter. It is
  very evident that, whatever might be the meaning of the words <i>him</i>
  and <i>them</i> their form would be dative. In this case the meaning
  being accusatives, and the form dative, we should doubt which test to
  take.</p>

  <p>My own opinion is, that it would be convenient to determine cases by
  the <i>form</i> of the word <i>alone</i>; so that, even if a word had a
  dative sense only once, where it had an accusative sense ten thousand
  times, such a word should be said to be in the dative case. Now the words
  <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page160"></a>[160]</span><i>him</i> and <i>them</i> (to which we
  may add <i>whom</i>) were once dative cases;<a name="footnotetag48"
  href="#footnote48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> <i>-m</i> in Anglo-Saxon being the
  sign of the dative case. In the time of the Anglo-Saxons their sense
  coincided with their form. At present they are dative forms with an
  accusative meaning. Still, as the word <i>give</i> takes after it a
  dative case, we have, even now, in the sentence, <i>give it him</i>,
  <i>give it them</i>, remnants of the old dative sense. To say <i>give it
  to him</i>, <i>to them</i>, is unnecessary and pedantic: neither do I
  object to the expression, <i>whom shall I give it?</i> If ever the
  <i>formal</i> test become generally recognised and consistently adhered
  to, <i>him</i>, <i>them</i>, and <i>whom</i> will be called datives with
  a latitude of meaning; and then the only true and unequivocal accusatives
  in the English language will be the forms <i>you</i>, <i>thee</i>,
  <i>us</i>, <i>me</i>, and <i>twain</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect217">§ 217</a>. <i>Analysis of cases.</i>&mdash;In the
  word <i>children's</i> we are enabled to separate the word into three
  parts. 1. The root <i>child</i>. 2. The plural signs <i>r</i> and
  <i>en</i>. 3. The sign of the genitive case, <i>s</i>. In this case the
  word is said to be analysed, since we not only take it to pieces, but
  also give the respective powers of each of its elements; stating which
  denotes the case, and which the number. Although it is too much to say
  that the analysis of every case of every number can be thus effected, it
  ought always to be attempted.</p>

  <p><a name="sect218">§ 218</a>. <i>The true nature of the genitive form
  in 's.</i>&mdash;It is a common notion that the genitive form
  <i>father's</i> is contracted from <i>father his</i>. The expression in
  our liturgy, <i>for Jesus Christ his sake</i>, which is merely a
  pleonastic one, is the only foundation for this assertion. As the idea,
  however, is not only one of the commonest, but also one of the greatest
  errors in etymology, the following <!-- Page 161 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>[161]</span>three statements are
  given for the sake of contradiction to it.</p>

  <p>1. The expression the <i>Queen's Majesty</i> is not capable of being
  reduced to the <i>Queen his Majesty</i>.</p>

  <p>2. In the form <i>his</i> itself, the <i>s</i> has precisely the power
  that it has in <i>father's</i>, &amp;c. Now <i>his</i> cannot be said to
  arise out of <i>he</i> + <i>his</i>.</p>

  <p>3. In the Slavonic, Lithuanic, and classical tongues, the genitive
  ends in <i>s</i>, just as it does in English; so that even if the words
  <i>father his</i> would account for the English word <i>father's</i>, it
  would not account for the Sanskrit genitive <i>pad-as</i>, of a foot; the
  Zend <i>dughdhar-s</i>, of a daughter; the Lithuanic <i>dugter-s</i>; the
  Greek <span title="odont-os" class="grk"
  >&#x1F40;&delta;&#x1F79;&nu;&tau;-&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>; the Latin
  <i>dent-is</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE PERSONAL PRONOUNS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect219">§ 219</a>. <i>I</i>, <i>we</i>, <i>us</i>,
  <i>me</i>, <i>thou</i>, <i>ye</i>.&mdash;These constitute the true
  personal pronouns. From <i>he</i>, <i>she</i>, and <i>it</i>, they differ
  in being destitute of gender.</p>

  <p>These latter words are demonstrative rather than personal, so that
  there are in English true personal pronouns for the first two persons
  only.</p>

  <p><a name="sect220">§ 220</a>. The usual declension of the personal
  pronouns is exceptionable. <i>I</i> and <i>me</i>, <i>thou</i> and
  <i>ye</i>, stand in no etymological relations to each other. The true
  view of the words is, that they are not irregular but defective. <i>I</i>
  has no <i>oblique</i>, and <i>me</i> no nominative case. And so it is
  with the rest.</p>

  <p><a name="sect221">§ 221</a>. <i>You</i>.&mdash;As far as the practice
  of the present mode of speech is concerned, the word <i>you</i> is a
  <i>nominative</i> form; since we say <i>you move</i>, <i>you are
  moving</i>, <i>you were speaking</i>.</p>

  <p>Why should it not be treated as such? There is no absolute reason why
  it should not. The Anglo-Saxon form for <i>you</i> was <i>eow</i>, for
  <i>ye</i>, <i>ge</i>. Neither bears any sign of case at all, so that,
  form for form, they are equally and indifferently nominative and
  accusative. Hence, it, perhaps, is more logical to say that a certain
  form (<i>you</i>), is used <i>either</i> as a nominative or accusative,
  than to say <!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page163"></a>[163]</span>that the accusative case is used instead
  of a nominative. It is clear that <i>you</i> can be used instead of
  <i>ye</i> only so far as it is nominative in power.</p>

  <p><i>Ye</i>.&mdash;As far as the evidence of such expressions as <i>get
  on with ye</i> is concerned, the word <i>ye</i> is an accusative form.
  The reasons why it should or should not be treated as such are involved
  in the previous paragraph.</p>

  <p><a name="sect222">§ 222</a>. <i>Me</i>.&mdash;carrying out the views
  just laid down, and admitting <i>you</i> to be a nominative, or
  <i>quasi</i>-nominative case, we may extend the reasoning to the word
  <i>me</i>, and call it also a secondary or equivocal nominative; inasmuch
  as such phrases as <span class="correction" title="Original reads `it is me it = is I'."
  ><i>it is me</i> = <i>it is I</i></span> are common.</p>

  <p>Now to call such expressions incorrect English is to assume the point.
  No one says that <i>c'est moi</i> is bad French, and that <i>c'est je</i>
  is good.</p>

  <p><a name="sect223">§ 223</a>. <i>Caution.</i>&mdash;Observe, however,
  that the expression <i>it is me</i> = <i>it is I</i> will not justify the
  use of <i>it is him</i>, <i>it is her</i> = <i>it is he</i> and <i>it is
  she</i>. <i>Me</i>, <i>ye</i>, <i>you</i>, are what may be called
  <i>indifferent forms</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, nominative as much as accusative,
  and accusative as much as nominative. <i>Him</i> and <i>her</i>, on the
  other hand, are not indifferent. The <i>-m</i> and <i>-r</i> are
  respectively the signs of cases other than the nominative.</p>

  <p><a name="sect224">§ 224</a>. Again: the reasons which allow the form
  <i>you</i> to be considered as a nominative plural, on the strength of
  its being used for <i>ye</i>, will not allow it to be considered a
  nominative singular on the strength of its being used for
  <i>thou</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect225">§ 225</a>. In phrases like <i>you are speaking</i>,
  &amp;c., even when applied to a single individual, the idea is really
  plural; in other words, the courtesy consists in treating <i>one</i>
  person as <i>more than one</i>, and addressing him as such, <!-- Page 164
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>[164]</span>rather than in
  using a plural form in a singular sense. It is certain that,
  grammatically considered, <i>you</i> = <i>thou</i> is a plural, since the
  verb with which it agrees is plural:&mdash;<i>you are speaking</i>, not
  <i>you art speaking</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE TRUE REFLECTIVE PRONOUN IN THE GOTHIC LANGUAGES, AND ON ITS ABSENCE IN ENGLISH.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect226">§ 226</a>. A true reflective pronoun is wanting in
  English. In other words, there are no equivalents to the Latin forms
  <i>sui</i>, <i>sibi</i>, <i>se</i>.</p>

  <p>Nor yet are there any equivalents to the forms <i>suus, sua, suum</i>:
  since <i>his</i> and <i>her</i> are the equivalents to <i>ejus</i> and
  <i>illius</i>, and are not adjectives but genitive cases.</p>

  <p>At the first view, this last sentence seems unnecessary. It might seem
  superfluous to state, that, if there were no such primitive form as
  <i>se</i>, there could be no such secondary form as <i>suus</i>.</p>

  <p>Such, however, is not the case. <i>Suus</i> might exist in the
  language, and yet <i>se</i> be absent; in other words, the derivative
  form might have continued whilst the original one had become extinct.</p>

  <p>Such is really the case with the <i>Old</i> Frisian. The reflective
  personal form, the equivalent to <i>se</i>, is lost, whilst the
  reflective possessive form, the equivalent to <i>suus</i>, is found. In
  the <i>Modern</i> Frisian, however, both forms are lost.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS,</span> &amp;c.</p>

  <p><a name="sect227">§ 227</a>. The demonstrative pronouns are, 1. <i>He,
  it</i>. 2. <i>She</i>. 3. <i>This, that</i>. 4. <i>The</i>.</p>

  <p><i>He</i>, <i>she</i>, and <i>it</i>, generally looked on as personal,
  are here treated as demonstrative pronouns, for the following
  reasons.</p>

  <p>1. The personal pronouns form an extremely natural class, if the
  pronouns of the two first persons be taken by themselves. This is not the
  case if they be taken along with <i>he</i>, <i>it</i>, and
  <i>she</i>.</p>

  <p>2. The idea expressed by <i>he</i>, <i>it</i>, and <i>she</i> is
  naturally that of demonstrativeness. In the Latin language <i>is, ea,
  id</i>; <i>ille, illa, illud</i>; <i>hic, hæc, hoc</i>, are demonstrative
  pronouns in sense, as well as in declension.</p>

  <p>3. The plural forms <i>they, them</i>, in the present English, are the
  plural forms of the root of <i>that</i>, a true demonstrative pronoun; so
  that even if <i>he</i>, <i>she</i>, and <i>it</i> could be treated as
  personal pronouns, <i>they</i> could not.</p>

  <p>4. The word <i>she</i> has grown out of the Anglo-Saxon <i>seó</i>.
  Now <i>seó</i> was in Anglo-Saxon the feminine form of the definite
  article; the definite article itself being originally a demonstrative
  pronoun.</p>

  <p><a name="sect228">§ 228</a>. Compared with the Anglo-Saxon the present
  English stands as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>She</i>.&mdash;The Anglo-Saxon form <i>heó</i>, being lost to the
  language, is replaced by the feminine article <i>seó</i>. <!-- Page 167
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>[167]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect229">§ 229</a>. <i>Her</i>.&mdash;This is a case, not of
  the present <i>she</i>, but of the Anglo-Saxon <i>heó</i>: so that
  <i>she</i> may be said to be defective in the oblique cases, and
  <i>her</i> to be defective in the nominative.</p>

  <p><i>Him</i>.&mdash;A dative form, which has replaced the Anglo-Saxon
  <i>hine</i>. When used as a dative, it was neuter as well as
  masculine.</p>

  <p><i>His</i>.&mdash;Originally neuter as well as masculine. Now as a
  neuter, replaced by <i>its</i>&mdash;"et quidem ipsa vox <i>his</i>, ut
  et interrogativum <i>whose</i>, nihil aliud sunt quam <i>hee's</i>,
  <i>who's</i>, ubi <i>s</i> omnino idem præstat quod in aliis possessivis.
  Similiter autem <i>his</i> pro <i>hee's</i> eodem errore quo nonnunquam
  <i>bin</i> pro <i>been</i>; item <i>whose</i> pro <i>who's</i> eodem
  errore quo <i>done</i>, <i>gone</i>, <i>knowne</i>, <i>growne</i>,
  &amp;c., pro <i>doen</i>, <i>goen</i>, <i>knowen,</i> vel <i>do'n</i>,
  <i>go'n</i>, <i>know'n</i>, <i>grow'n</i>; utrobique contra analogiam
  linguæ; sed usu defenditur."&mdash;Wallis, c.v.</p>

  <p><i>It</i>.&mdash;Changed from the Anglo-Saxon <i>hit</i>, by the
  ejection of <i>h</i>. The <i>t</i> is no part of the original word, but a
  sign of the neuter gender, forming it regularly from <i>he</i>. The same
  neuter sign is preserved in the Latin <i>id</i> and <i>illud</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Its</i>.&mdash;In the course of time the nature of the neuter sign
  <i>t</i>, in <i>it</i>, the form being found in but a few words, became
  misunderstood. Instead of being looked on as an affix, it passed for part
  of the original word. Hence was formed from <i>it</i> the anomalous
  genitive <i>its</i> superseding the Saxon <i>his</i>. The same was the
  case with&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Hers</i>.&mdash;The <i>r</i> is no part of the original word, but
  the sign of the dative case. These formations are of value in the history
  of cases.</p>

  <p><a name="sect230">§ 230</a>. <i>Theirs</i>.&mdash;In the same
  predicament with <i>hers</i> and <i>its</i>; either the case of an
  adjective, or a case formed from a case.</p>

  <p><i>Than</i> or <i>then</i>, and <i>there</i>.&mdash;Although now
  adverbs, <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page168"></a>[168]</span>they were once demonstrative pronouns, in
  a certain case and in a certain gender, <i>viz.</i>, <i>than</i> and
  <i>then</i> masculine accusative and singular, <i>there</i> feminine
  dative and singular.</p>

  <p><a name="sect231">§ 231</a>. An exhibition of the Anglo-Saxon
  declension is the best explanation of the English. Be it observed, that
  the cases marked in italics are found in the present language.</p>

<p class="cenhead">I.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Se, seó</i> ( = <i>she</i>).</p>

  <p>Of this word we meet two forms only, both of the singular number, and
  both in the nominative case; <i>viz.</i>, masc., <i>se</i>; fem.
  <i>seó</i> ( = the). The neuter gender and the other cases of the article
  were taken from the pronoun <i>þæt</i> ( = that).</p>

  <p>In Old English MSS. this plural in <i>-e</i> is general. It occurs not
  only in adjectives and pronouns as a regular inflection, but even as a
  plural of the genitive <i>his</i>, that word being treated as a
  nominative singular; so that <i>hise</i> is formed from <i>his</i>, as

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE RELATIVE, INTERROGATIVE, AND CERTAIN OTHER PRONOUNS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect234">§ 234</a>. In the relative and interrogative
  pronouns, <i>who</i>, <i>what</i>, <i>whom</i>, <i>whose</i>, we have,
  expressed by a change of form, a neuter gender, <i>what</i>; a dative
  case <i>whom</i>; and a genitive case, <i>whose</i>: the true power of
  the <i>s</i> (<i>viz.</i>, as the sign of a case) being obscured by the
  orthographical addition of the <i>e</i> mute.</p>

  <p>To these may be added, 1. the adverb <i>why</i>, originally the
  ablative form <i>hvi</i> (<i>quo modo?</i> <i>quâ viâ?</i>). 2. The
  adverb <i>where</i>, a feminine dative, like <i>there</i>. 3.
  <i>When</i>, a masculine accusative (in Anglo-Saxon <i>hwæne</i>), and
  analogous to <i>then</i>.</p>

  <p>The two sounds in the Danish words <i>hvi</i>, <i>hvad</i>, &amp;c.,
  and the two sounds in the English, <i>what</i>, <i>when</i> (Anglo-Saxon,
  <i>hwæt</i>, <i>hwæne</i>) account for the forms <i>why</i> and
  <i>how</i>. In the first the <i>w</i> alone, in the second the <i>h</i>
  alone, is sounded. The Danish for <i>why</i> is <i>hvi</i>, pronounced
  <i>vi</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect235">§ 235</a>. The following remarks (some of them not
  strictly etymological) apply to a few of the remaining pronouns.</p>

  <p><i>Same</i>.&mdash;Wanting in Anglo-Saxon, where it was replaced by
  the word <i>ylca</i>, <i>ylce</i>. Probably derived from the Norse.</p>

  <p><i>Self</i>.&mdash;In <i>myself</i>, <i>thyself</i>, <i>herself</i>,
  <i>ourselves</i>, <i>yourselves</i>, <!-- Page 174 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>[174]</span>a substantive (or with
  a substantival power), and preceded by a genitive case. In <i>himself</i>
  and <i>themselves</i> an adjective (or with an adjectival power), and
  preceded by an accusative case. <i>Itself</i> is equivocal, since we
  cannot say whether its elements are <i>it</i> and <i>self</i>, or
  <i>its</i> and <i>self</i>; the <i>s</i> having been dropped in
  utterance. It is very evident that either the form like <i>himself</i>,
  or the form like <i>thyself</i>, is exceptionable; in other words, that
  the use of the word is inconsistent. As this inconsistency is as old as
  the Anglo-Saxons, the history of the word gives us no elucidation. In
  favour of the forms like <i>myself</i> (<i>self</i> being a substantive),
  are the following facts:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The plural word <i>selves</i>, a substantival, and not an
  adjectival form.</p>

  <p>2. The Middle High German phrases <i>mîn lîp</i>, <i>dîn lîp</i>,
  <i>my body</i>, <i>thy body</i>, equivalent in sense to <i>myself</i>,
  <i>thyself</i>.</p>

  <p>3. The circumstance that if <i>self</i> be dealt with as a
  substantive, such phrases as <i>my own self</i>, <i>his own great
  self</i>, &amp;c., can be used; whereby the language is a gainer.</p>

  <p>"Vox <i>self</i>, pluraliter <i>selves</i>, quamvis etiam pronomen a
  quibusdam censeatur (quoniam ut plurimum per Latinum <i>ipse</i>
  redditur), est tamen plane nomen substantivum, cui quidem vix aliquod
  apud Latinos substantivum respondet; proxime tamen accedet vox
  <i>persona</i> vel <i>propria persona</i> ut <i>my self</i>, <i>thy
  self</i>, <i>our selves</i>, <i>your selves</i>, &amp;c. (<i>ego
  ipse</i>, <i>tu ipse</i>, <i>nos ipsi</i>, <i>vos ipsi</i>, &amp;c.), ad
  verbum <i>mea persona</i>, <i>tua persona</i>, &amp;c. Fateor tamen
  <i>himself</i>, <i>itself</i>, <i>themselves</i>, vulgo dici pro
  <i>his-self</i>, <i>its-self</i>, <i>theirselves</i>; at (interposito
  <i>own</i>) <i>his own self</i>, &amp;c., <i>ipsius propria persona</i>,
  &amp;c."&mdash;Wallis. c. vii.</p>

  <p>4. The fact that many persons actually say <i>hisself</i> and
  <i>theirselves</i>. <!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page175"></a>[175]</span></p>

  <p><i>Whit</i>.&mdash;As in the phrase <i>not a whit</i>. This enters in
  the compound pronouns <i>aught</i> and <i>naught</i>.</p>

  <p><i>One</i>.&mdash;As in the phrase <i>one does so and so</i>. From the
  French <i>on</i>. Observe that this is from the Latin <i>homo</i>, in Old
  French <i>hom</i>, <i>om</i>. In the Germanic tongues <i>man</i> is used
  in the same sense: <i>man sagt</i> = <i>one says</i> = <i>on dit</i>.
  <i>One</i>, like <i>self</i> and <i>other</i>, is so far a substantive,
  that it is inflected. Gen. sing, <i>one's own self</i>: plural, <i>my
  wife and little ones are well</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Derived pronouns.</i>&mdash;<i>Any</i>, in Anglo-Saxon,
  <i>ænig</i>. In Old High German we have <i>einîc</i> = <i>any</i>, and
  <i>einac</i> = <i>single</i>. In Anglo-Saxon <i>ânega</i> means
  <i>single</i>. In Middle High German <i>einec</i> is always single. In
  New High German <i>einig</i> means, 1. <i>a certain person</i>
  (<i>quidam</i>), 2. <i>agreeing</i>; <i>einzig</i>, meaning
  <i>single</i>. In Dutch <i>ênech</i> has both meanings. This indicates
  the word <i>án</i>, <i>one</i>, as the root of the word in question.</p>

  <p><i>Compound pronouns.</i>&mdash;<i>Which</i>, as has been already
  stated more than once, is most incorrectly called the neuter of
  <i>who</i>. Instead of being a neuter, it is a compound word. The
  adjective <i>leiks</i>, <i>like</i>, is preserved in the
  M&oelig;so-Gothic words <i>galeiks</i> and <i>missaleiks</i>. In Old High
  German the form is <i>lih</i>, in Anglo-Saxon <i>lic</i>. Hence we have
  M&oelig;so-Gothic <i>hvêleiks</i>; Old High German, <i>huëlih</i>;
  Anglo-Saxon, <i>huilic</i> and <i>hvilc</i>; Old Frisian, <i>hwelik</i>;
  Danish, <i>hvilk-en</i>; German, <i>welch</i>; Scotch, <i>whilk</i>;
  English, <i>which</i>. The same is the case with&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. <i>Such</i>.&mdash;M&oelig;so-Gothic, <i>svaleiks</i>; Old High
  German, <i>sôlîh</i>; Old Saxon, <i>sulîc</i>; Anglo-Saxon, <i>svilc</i>;
  German, <i>solch</i>; English, <i>such</i>. Rask's derivation of the
  Anglo-Saxon <i>swilc</i> from <i>swa-ylc</i>, is exceptionable.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Thilk</i>.&mdash;An old English word, found in the provincial
  dialects, as <i>thick</i>, <i>thuck</i>, <i>theck</i>, and hastily
  derived by Tyrwhitt, Ritson, and Weber, from <i>së ylca</i>, is found
  <!-- Page 176 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page176"></a>[176]</span>in the following forms: M&oelig;so-Gothic,
  <i>þéleiks</i>; Norse, <i>þvilikr</i>.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Ilk</i>.&mdash;Found in the Scotch, and always preceded by the
  article; <i>the ilk</i>, or <i>that ilk</i>, meaning <i>the same</i>. In
  Anglo-Saxon this word is <i>ycla</i>, preceded also by the article <i>se
  ylca</i>, <i>seó ylce</i>, <i>þæt ylce</i>. In English, as seen above,
  the word is replaced by <i>same</i>. In no other Gothic dialect does it
  occur. According to Grimm, this is no simple word, but a compound one, of
  which some such <span class="correction" title="Original reads `wore'."
  >word</span> as <i>ei</i> is the first, and <i>lîc</i> the second
  element.</p>

  <p><i>Aught</i>.&mdash;In M&oelig;so-Gothic is found the particle,
  <i>aiv</i>, <i>ever</i>, but only in negative propositions; <i>ni</i>
  (<i>not</i>) preceding it. Its Old High German form is <i>êo</i>,
  <i>io</i>; in Middle High German, <i>ie</i>; in New High German,
  <i>je</i>; in Old Saxon, <i>io</i>; in Anglo-Saxon, <i>â</i>; in Norse,
  <i>æ</i>. Combined with this particle the word <i>whit</i> (<i>thing</i>)
  gives the following forms: Old High German, <i>êowiht</i>; Anglo-Saxon,
  <i>âviht</i>; Old Frisian, <i>âwet</i>; English <i>aught</i>. The word
  <i>naught</i> is <i>aught</i> preceded by the negative particle.</p>

  <p><i>Each</i>.&mdash;The particle <i>gi</i> enters, like the particle in
  the composition of pronouns. Old High German, <i>êogalîher</i>, every
  one; <i>êocalih</i>, all; Middle High German, <i>iegelich</i>; New High
  German, <i>jeglich</i>; Anglo-Saxon, <i>ælc</i>; English, <i>each</i>;
  the <i>l</i> being dropped, as in <i>which</i> and <i>such</i>.
  <i>Ælc</i>, as the original of the English <i>each</i> and the Scotch
  <i>ilka</i>,<a name="footnotetag51"
  href="#footnote51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> must by no means be confounded
  with the word <i>ylce</i>, <i>the same</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Every</i> in Old English, <i>everich</i>, <i>everech</i>,
  <i>everilk one</i>, is <i>ælc</i>, preceded by the particle <i>ever</i>.
  (Grimm. D. G. iii. 54.)</p>

  <p><i>Either</i>.&mdash;Old High German, <i>êogahuëdar</i>; Middle High
  German, <i>iegewëder</i>; Anglo-Saxon, <i>æghväðer</i>, <i>ægðer</i>; Old
  Frisian, <i>eider</i>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>[177]</span></p>

  <p><i>Neither</i>.&mdash;The same with the negative article prefixed.
  <i>Neither</i> : <i>either</i> :: <i>naught</i> : <i>aught</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect236">§ 236</a>. <i>Other</i>, <i>whether</i>.&mdash;These
  words, although derived forms, being simpler than some that have
  preceded, might fairly have been dealt with before. They make, however, a
  transition from the present to the succeeding chapter, and so find a
  place here.</p>

  <p>A. <i>First</i>, it may be stated of them that the idea which they
  express is not that of <i>one out of many</i>, but that of <i>one out of
  two</i>.</p>

  <p>1. In Sanscrit there are two forms, <sup>a</sup>) <i>kataras</i>, the
  same word as <i>whether</i>, meaning <i>which out of two</i>;
  <sup>b</sup>) <i>katamas, which out of many</i>. So also <i>êkateras, one
  out of two</i>; <i>êkatamas, one out of many</i>. In Greek the Ionic form
  <span title="koteros (poteros" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&#x1F79;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;
  (&pi;&#x1F79;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;)</span>; in Latin,
  <i>uter</i>, <i>neuter</i>, <i>alter</i>; and in M&oelig;so-Gothic,
  <i>hvathar</i>, have the same form and the same meaning.</p>

  <p>2. In the Scandinavian language the word <i>anden</i>, Dano-Saxon,
  <i>annar</i>, Iceland. corresponds to the English word <i>second</i>, and
  not the German <i>zweite</i>: e.g., <i>Karl den Anden, Charles the
  Second</i>. Now <i>anthar</i> is the older form of <i>other</i>.</p>

  <p>B. <i>Secondly</i>, it may be stated of them, that the termination
  <i>-er</i> is the same termination that we find in the comparative
  degree.</p>

  <p>1. The idea expressed by the comparative degree is the comparison, not
  of <i>many</i> but of <i>two</i> things; <i>this is better than
  that</i>.</p>

  <p>2. In all the Indo-European languages where there are pronouns in
  <i>-ter</i>, there is also a comparative degree in <i>-ter</i>. See next
  chapter.</p>

  <p>3. As the Sanscrit form <i>kataras</i> corresponds with the
  comparative degree, where there is the comparison of <i>two things with
  each other</i>; so the word <i>katamas</i> is a <!-- Page 178 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>[178]</span>superlative form; and
  in the superlative degree lies the comparison of <i>many</i> things with
  each other.</p>

  <p>Hence <i>other</i> and <i>whether</i> (to which may be added
  <i>either</i> and <i>neither</i>) are pronouns with the comparative
  form.</p>

  <p><i>Other</i> has the additional peculiarity of possessing the plural
  form <i>others</i>. Hence, like <i>self</i>, it is, in the strictest
  sense, a substantival pronoun.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON CERTAIN FORMS IN -ER.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect237">§ 237</a>. Preparatory to the consideration of the
  degrees of comparison, it is necessary to make some remarks upon a
  certain class of words, which, with considerable differences of
  signification, all agree in one fact, <i>viz.</i>, all terminate in
  <i>-er</i>, or <i>t-er</i>.</p>

  <p>1. Certain pronouns, as <i>ei-th-er</i>, <i>n-ei-th-er</i>,
  <i>whe-th-er</i>, or <i>o-th-er</i>.</p>

  <p>2. Certain prepositions and adverbs, as <i>ov-er</i>, <i>und-er</i>,
  <i>af-t-er</i>.</p>

  <p>3. Certain adjectives, with the form of the comparative, but the power
  of the positive degree; as <i>upp-er</i>, <i>und-er</i>, <i>inn-er</i>,
  <i>out-er</i>, <i>hind-er</i>.</p>

  <p>4. All adjectives of the comparative degree; as <i>wis-er</i>,
  <i>strong-er</i>, <i>bett-er</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Now what is the idea common to all these words, expressed by the sign
  <i>-er</i>, and connecting the four divisions into one class? It is not
  the mere idea of comparison; although it is the comparative degree, to
  the expression of which the affix in question is more particularly
  applied. Bopp, who has best generalised the view of these forms,
  considers the fundamental idea to be that of <i>duality</i>. In the
  comparative degree we have a relation between one object and <i>some</i>
  other object like it, or a relation between two single elements of
  comparison: <i>A is wiser than B</i>. In the superlative degree we have a
  relation between one <!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page180"></a>[180]</span>object and <i>all</i> others like it, or a
  relation between one single and one complex element of comparison: <i>A
  is wiser than B, C, D</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>"As in comparatives a relation between <i>two</i>, and in superlatives
  a relation between <i>many</i>, lies at the bottom, it is natural that
  their suffixes should be transferred to other words, whose chief notion
  is individualised through that of duality or
  plurality."&mdash;"Vergleichende Grammatik," § 292, Eastwick's and
  Wilson's Translation.</p>

  <p>The most important proofs of the view adduced by Bopp are,&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The Sanskrit form <i>kataras</i> = <i>which of </i>two<i>
  persons?</i> is a comparative form; whilst <i>katamas</i> = <i>which of
  more than two persons?</i> a superlative form. Similarly, <i>êkataras</i>
  = <i>one of two persons</i>; <i>êkatamas</i> = <i>one of more than two
  persons</i>.</p>

  <p>2. The Greek forms, <span title="hekateros" class="grk"
  >&#x1F11;&kappa;&#x1F71;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> =
  <i>each</i> (<i>or either</i>) <i>out of two persons</i>; whilst <span

  <p><a name="sect238">§ 238</a>. The more important of the specific
  modifications of the general idea involved in the comparison of two
  objects are,&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Contrariety: as in <i>inner</i>, <i>outer</i>, <i>under</i>,
  <i>upper</i>, <i>over</i>. In Latin the words for <i>right</i> and
  <i>left</i> end in <i>-er</i>,&mdash;<i>dexter</i>, <i>sinister</i>.</p>

  <p>2. Choice in the way of an alternative; as <i>either</i>,
  <i>neither</i>, <i>whether</i>, <i>other</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect239">§ 239</a>. <i>Either</i>, <i>neither</i>,
  <i>other</i>, <i>whether</i>.&mdash;It has just been stated that the
  general fundamental idea common to all these forms is that of <i>choice
  between one of two objects in the way of an alternative</i>. Thus far the
  termination <i>-er</i> in <i>either</i>, &amp;c., is the termination
  <i>-er</i> in the true comparatives, <i>brav-er</i>, <i>wis-er</i>,
  &amp;c. <i>Either</i> and <i>neither</i> are common pronouns.
  <i>Other</i>, like <i>one</i>, is a <!-- Page 181 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>[181]</span>pronoun capable of
  taking the plural form of a substantive (<i>others</i>), and also that of
  the genitive case (<i>the other's money, the other's bread</i>).
  <i>Whether</i> is a pronoun in the almost obsolete form <i>whether</i> (
  = <i>which</i>) <i>of the two do you prefer</i>, and a conjunction in
  sentences like <i>whether will you do this or not</i>? The use of the
  form <i>others</i> is recent. "<i>They are taken out of the way as all

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE COMPARATIVE DEGREE.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect240">§ 240</a>. There are four leading facts
  here,&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. <i>The older form in -s.</i> In English we say old-<i>er</i>,
  bett-<i>er</i>, sweet-<i>er</i>; in Old High German they similarly said,
  alt-<i>iro</i>, bets-<i>iro</i>, suats-<i>iro</i>; but in
  M&oelig;so-Gothic the forms were ald-<i>iza</i>, bat-<i>iza</i>,
  sut-<i>iza</i>.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Adverbs</i> are susceptible of comparison;
  <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;<i>Come as soon as you can, but do not come sooner than
  is convenient</i>.</p>

  <p>3. The Anglo-Saxon comparison of the adverbs is different from that of
  the adjectives; there being one form in <i>-re</i> and <i>-este</i>,
  another in <i>-or</i> and <i>-ost</i> respectively. Now the first of
  these was the form taken by adjectives: as <i>se scearp-re sweord</i> =
  <i>the sharper sword</i>, and <i>se scearp-este sword</i> = <i>the
  sharpest sword</i>. The second, on the other hand, was the form taken by
  adverbs: as, <i>se sweord scyrð scearp-or</i> = <i>the sword cuts
  sharper</i>, and <i>se sweord scyrð scearp-ost</i> = <i>the sword cuts
  sharpest</i>.</p>

  <p>4. In the Anglo-Saxon, the following words exhibit a change of
  vowel.</p>

</table>

<p><!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>[183]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect241">§ 241</a>. Now the fourth of these facts explains
  the present forms <i>elder</i> and <i>eldest</i>, the comparatives and
  superlative of <i>old</i>, besides which there are the regular forms
  <i>old-er</i> and <i>old-est</i>; between which there is, however, a
  difference in meaning&mdash;<i>elder</i> being used as a substantive, and
  having a plural form, <i>elders</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect242">§ 242</a>. The abverbial forms in <i>-or</i> and
  <i>-ost</i>, as compared with the adjectival in <i>-re</i>, and
  <i>-este</i> explain the form <i>rather</i>. This rhymes to
  <i>father</i>; the <i>a</i> being full. Nevertheless, the positive form
  is <i>rather</i> meaning <i>quick, easy</i> = the classical root <span
  title="rhad-" class="grk">&#x1FE5;&alpha;&delta;-</span> in <span
  title="rhadios" class="grk"
  >&#x1FE5;&#x1F71;&delta;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>. What we do
  <i>quickly</i> and <i>willingly</i> we do <i>preferably</i>. Now if the
  word <i>rather</i> were an adjective, the vowel of the comparative would
  be sounded as the <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>, as it is, however, it is
  abverbial, and as such is properly sounded as the <i>a</i> in
  <i>father</i>.</p>

  <p>The difference between the action of the small vowel in <i>-re</i>,
  and of the full in <i>-or</i> effects this difference, since <i>o</i>
  being a full vowel, it has the effect of making the <i>a</i> full
  also.</p>

  <p><a name="sect243">§ 243</a>. The old form in <i>-s</i> will be
  considered, after notice has been taken of what may be called&mdash;</p>

  <p><a name="sect244">§ 244</a>. <i>Excess of expression.</i>&mdash;Of
  this two samples have already been given: 1. in words like
  <i>songstress</i>; 2. in words like <i>children</i>. This may be called
  <i>excess of expression</i>; the feminine gender, in words like
  <i>songstress</i>, and the plural number, in words like <i>children</i>,
  being expressed twice over. In the vulgarism <i>betterer</i> for
  <i>better</i>, and in the antiquated forms <i>worser</i> for
  <i>worse</i>, and <i>lesser</i> for <i>less</i>, we have, in the case of
  the comparatives, as elsewhere, an excess of expression. In the old High
  German we have the forms <i>betsërôro</i>, <i>mêrôro</i>, <i>êrërëra</i>
  = <i>better</i>, <i>more</i>, <i>ere</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect245">§ 245</a>. <i>Better</i>.&mdash;Although in the
  superlative form <i>best</i> <!-- Page 184 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page184"></a>[184]</span>there is a slight variation from the
  strict form of that degree, the word <i>better</i> is perfectly regular.
  So far, then, from truth are the current statements that the comparison
  of the words <i>good, better</i>, and <i>best</i> is irregular. The
  inflection is not irregular, but defective. As the statement that applies
  to <i>good</i>, <i>better</i>, and <i>best</i> applies to many words
  besides, it will be well in this place, once for all, to exhibit it in
  full.</p>

  <p><a name="sect246">§ 246</a>. <i>Difference between a sequence in logic
  and a sequence in etymology.</i>&mdash;The ideas or notions of <i>thou,
  thy, thee</i>, are ideas between which there is a metaphysical or logical
  connexion. The train of such ideas may be said to form a sequence, and
  such a sequence may be called a logical one.</p>

  <p>The words <i>thou, thy, thee</i>, are words between which there is a
  <i>formal</i> or an <i>etymological</i> connexion. A train of such words
  may be called a sequence, and such a sequence may be called an
  etymological one.</p>

  <p>In the case of <i>thou, thy, thee</i>, the etymological sequence
  tallies with the <i>logical</i> one.</p>

  <p>The ideas of <i>I</i>, <i>my</i>, and <i>me</i> are also in a logical
  sequence: but the forms <i>I</i>, <i>my</i>, and <i>me</i> are not
  altogether in an etymological one.</p>

  <p>In the case of <i>I, my, me</i>, the etymological sequence does
  <i>not</i> tally (or tallies imperfectly) with the logical one.</p>

  <p>This is only another way of saying that between the words <i>I</i> and
  <i>me</i> there is no connexion in etymology.</p>

  <p>It is also only another way of saying, that, in the oblique cases,
  <i>I</i>, and, in the nominative case, <i>me</i>, are
  <i>defective</i>.</p>

  <p>Now the same is the case with <i>good, better</i>, <i>bad, worse</i>,
  &amp;c. <i>Good</i> and <i>bad</i> are defective in the comparative and
  superlative degrees; <i>better</i> and <i>worse</i> are <!-- Page 185
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>[185]</span>defective in
  the positive; whilst between <i>good</i> and <i>better</i>, <i>bad</i>
  and <i>worse</i>, there is a sequence in logic, but no sequence in
  etymology.</p>

  <p><a name="sect247">§ 247</a>. To return, however, to the word
  <i>better</i>; no absolute positive degree is found in any of the allied
  languages, and in none of the allied languages is there found any
  comparative form of <i>good</i>. Its root occurs in the following
  adverbial forms: M&oelig;so-Gothic, <i>bats</i>; Old High German,
  <i>pats</i>; Old Saxon and Anglo-Saxon, <i>bet</i>; Middle High German,
  <i>baz</i>; Middle Dutch, <i>bat</i>, <i>bet</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect248">§ 248</a>. <i>Worse</i>.&mdash;This word is one of
  two things.</p>

  <p>1. It is a positive form with a comparative sense; in which case
  <i>s</i> is part of the root.</p>

  <p>2. It is a comparative degree from the positive form <i>wor-</i>
  (<i>vair-</i>, <i>wir-</i>, <i>vyr-</i>), in which case <i>s</i> is the
  <i>s</i> of the Old M&oelig;so-Gothic inflexion preserved in this single
  word.</p>

  <p><a name="sect249">§ 249</a>. <i>More</i>.&mdash;In Anglo-Saxon this is
  <i>mâ</i>; in the English of the reign of Elizabeth it is <i>moe</i>; and
  in certain provincial dialects it is <i>mo</i>, at the present time.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding this, <i>i.e.</i>, the form being positive, the
  <i>power</i> of the word has always been comparative, and meant
  <i>more</i> rather than <i>much</i>, or <i>many</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect250">§ 250</a>. <i>Less</i>.&mdash;In Anglo-Saxon
  <i>læssa</i> and <i>læs</i>. Here there is no <i>unequivocal</i> sign of
  the comparative degree; what, then, is the nature of the word? Is it a
  positive form with a comparative power like <i>moe</i>? or is it an old
  comparative in <i>-s</i>? This is undecided. What does it come from?
  Grimm derives it from the M&oelig;so-Gothic root <i>lasiv</i> =
  <i>weak</i>. His doctrine is doubtful. I cannot but believe that it comes
  from the same root as <i>litt-le</i>; where the old Frisian form
  <i>litich</i>, shows that the <i>-l</i> is no essential part of the word,
  and the Danish form <i>lille</i> gets <!-- Page 186 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>[186]</span>rid of the <i>t</i>.
  Still the word is difficult; indeed it is unexplained.</p>

  <p><a name="sect251">§ 251</a>. <i>Near</i>,
  <i>nearer</i>.&mdash;Anglo-Saxon, <i>neah</i>; comparative,
  <i>nearre</i>, <i>near</i>, <i>nyr</i>; superlative, <i>nyhst</i>,
  <i>nehst</i>. Observe, in the Anglo-Saxon positive and superlative, the
  absence of the <i>r</i>. This shows that the English positive <i>near</i>
  is the Anglo-Saxon comparative <i>nearre</i>, and that in the secondary
  comparative <i>nearer</i>, we have an <i>excess of expression</i>. It may
  be, however, that the <i>r</i> in <i>near</i> is a mere point of
  orthography, and that it is not pronounced; since, in the English
  language the words <i>father</i> and <i>farther</i> are, for the most
  part, pronounced alike.</p>

  <p><a name="sect252">§ 252</a>. <i>Farther</i>.&mdash;Anglo-Saxon
  <i>feor, fyrre, fyrrest</i>. The <i>th</i> seems euphonic, inserted by
  the same process that gives the <span class="grk">&delta;</span> in <span
  title="andros" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&nu;&delta;&rho;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;</span>, from <span title="anêr" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&nu;&#x1F74;&rho;</span> = man.</p>

  <p><i>Further</i>.&mdash;Confounded with <i>farther</i>, although in
  reality from a different word, <i>fore</i>. Old High German,
  <i>furdir</i>; New High German, <i>der vordere</i>; Anglo-Saxon,
  <i>fyrðre</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect253">§ 253</a>. <i>Former</i>.&mdash;A comparative formed
  from the superlative; <i>forma</i> being such. Consequently, an instance
  of excess of expression, combined with irregularity.</p>

  <p><a name="sect254">§ 254</a>. In M&oelig;so-Gothic <i>spêdists</i>
  means <i>last</i>, and <i>spêdiza</i> = <i>later</i>. Of the word
  <i>spêdists</i> two views may be taken. According to one it is the
  positive degree with the addition of <i>st</i>; according to the other,
  it is the comparative degree with the addition only of <i>t</i>. Now,
  Grimm and others lay down as a rule, that the superlative is formed, not
  directly from the positive, but indirectly through the comparative.</p>

  <p>With the exception of <i>worse</i> and <i>less</i>, all the English
  comparatives end in <i>-r</i>: yet no superlative ends in <i>-rt</i>, the
  form being, not <i>wise, wiser, wisert</i>, but <i>wise, wiser,
  wisest</i>. This fact, without invalidating the notion just laid down,
  gives additional importance to the comparative forms in <i>s</i>; <!--
  Page 187 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>[187]</span>since
  it is from these, before they have changed to <i>r</i>, that we must
  suppose the superlatives to have been derived. The theory being admitted,
  we can, by approximation, determine the comparative antiquity of the
  superlative degree. It was introduced <i>after</i> the establishment of
  the comparative, and <i>before</i> the change of <i>-s</i> into
  <i>-r</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect255">§ 255</a>. The Anglo-Saxon word for <i>first</i> was
  <i>for-m-a</i>.</p>

  <p>The root was <i>for</i> = the Latin <i>præ</i>, the Greek <span
  title="pro" class="grk">&pi;&rho;&omicron;</span>, and being the same
  combination which occurs in <i>fore</i>, <i>fore-m-ost</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The <i>m</i> was the Anglo-Saxon sign of the superlative degree.</p>

  <p>It is the <i>m</i> in the Latin words <i>pri-m-us</i>,
  <i>inti-m-us</i>, <i>exti-m-us</i>, <i>ulti-m-us</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>It occurs even in the Gothic tongues; in other words, besides
  <i>for-m-a</i>.</p>

  <p>In short, <i>m</i> is an old sign of the superlative degree; probably
  older than the usual form, <i>-st</i>, discussed in § <a
  href="#sect254">254</a>. This has some important applications.</p>

  <p><a name="sect256">§ 256</a>. <i>Former</i>.&mdash;This is a remarkable
  word: it is a comparative derived from the Anglo-Saxon superlative, and
  its analysis is <i>for-m-er</i>, with <i>excess of inflexion</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect257">§ 257</a>. <i>Nea-r-est</i>.&mdash;Here the <i>r</i>
  is no part of the original root, as may be seen in § <a
  href="#sect251">251</a>. It has grown out of <i>-ah</i> pronounced as the
  <i>a</i> in <i>father</i>. The true forms are positive, <i>neah</i>;
  comparative, <i>neah-er</i>; superlative, <i>neah-est</i>. Such, to a
  certain extent, is really the case.</p>

  <p><a name="sect258">§ 258</a>. <i>Next</i>.&mdash;The superlative of
  <i>nigh</i>, contracted from <i>nigh-est</i>. The Anglo-Saxon forms were
  <i>neah</i>, <i>nyh-st</i>, <i>neh-st</i>, <i>nyh-ste</i>. In Anglo-Saxon
  the letter <i>h</i> was pronounced strongly, and sounded like <i>g</i> or
  <i>k</i>. This fact is <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page189"></a>[189]</span>still shown in the spelling; as
  <i>ni</i>gh. In the word <i>next</i> this sound is preserved, slightly
  changed into that of <i>k</i>; <i>next</i> = <i>nek-st</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="correction" title="Original reads `250'."><a
  name="sect259">§ 259</a>.</span> <i>Upmost</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;The common
  statement concerning words like <i>upmost</i> is, that they are compound
  words, formed by the addition of the word <i>most</i>: this, however, is
  more than doubtful.</p>

  <p>The Anglo-Saxon language presents us with the following
  forms:&mdash;</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Forms in -most." title="Forms in -most.">
<tr><td class="spacsingle" align="center"><i>Anglo-Saxon.</i></td><td class="spacsingle" align="center"><i>English.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Innema (inn-ema),</td><td class="spacsingle">Inmost (in-m-ost).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Ûtema (ût-ma),</td><td class="spacsingle">Outmost (out-m-ost).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Siðema (sið-ema),</td><td class="spacsingle">Latest.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Lætema (læt-ema),</td><td class="spacsingle">Latest.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Niðema (nið-ema),</td><td class="spacsingle">Nethermost (neth-er-m-ost).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Forma (for-ma),</td><td class="spacsingle">Foremost (fore-m-ost).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Æftema (aft-ema),</td><td class="spacsingle">Aftermost (aft-er-m-ost).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Ufema (uf-ema),</td><td class="spacsingle">Upmost (up-m-ost).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Hindema (hind-ema),</td><td class="spacsingle">Hindmost (hind-m-ost).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Midema (mid-ema),</td><td class="spacsingle">Midmost (mid-m-ost).</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Now the words in question show at once, that, as far as they are
  concerned, the <i>m</i> that appears in the last syllable of each has
  nothing to do with the word <i>most</i>.</p>

  <p>From the words in question there was formed, in Anglo-Saxon, a regular
  superlative form in the usual manner; <i>viz.</i>, by the addition of
  <i>-st</i>; as <i>æfte-m-est</i>, <i>fyr-m-est</i>, <i>læte-m-est</i>,
  <i>sið-m-est</i>, <i>yfe-m-est</i>, <i>ute-m-est</i>,
  <i>inne-m-est</i>.</p>

  <p>Hence, in the present English, the different parts of the syllable
  <i>most</i> (in words like <i>upmost</i>) come from different quarters.
  The <i>m</i> is the <i>m</i> in the Anglo-Saxon words <i>innema</i>,
  &amp;c.; whilst the <i>-st</i> is the common sign of the superlative.
  Hence, in separating such words as <i>midmost</i> into its component
  parts, we should write <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE CARDINAL NUMBERS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect261">§ 261</a>. Generally speaking, the greater part of
  the cardinal numbers are undeclined. As far as <i>number</i> goes, this

  <p><i>Two</i> is naturally <i>dual</i>.</p>

  <p>The rest are naturally and exclusively <i>plural</i>.</p>

  <p>As to the inflection of gender and case, there is no reason why all

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE ORDINAL NUMBERS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect262">§ 262</a>. By referring to § <a
  href="#sect259">259</a>, we see that <i>-m</i> was an early sign of the
  superlative degree. This bears upon the numerals <i>seven</i>,
  <i>nine</i>, and <i>ten</i>.</p>

  <p>These are <i>cardinal</i> numbers. Nevertheless, the present chapter
  is the proper place for noticing them.</p>

  <p>There is good reason for believing that the final <i>-n</i> is no part
  of the original root. Thus,&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> <i>Sev-en</i> = the Latin <i>sept-em</i>, where the
  <i>-m</i> is equivalent to the <i>-n</i>. But in the Greek <span

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE ARTICLES.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect267">§ 267</a>. In the generality of grammars the
  definite article <i>the</i>, and the indefinite article <i>an</i>, are
  the very first parts of speech that are considered. This is
  exceptionable. So far are they from being essential to language, that, in
  many dialects, they are wholly wanting. In Greek there is no indefinite,
  in Latin there is neither an indefinite nor a definite article. In the
  former language they say <span title="anêr tis" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&nu;&#x1F75;&rho; &tau;&iota;&sigmaf;</span> = <i>a certain
  man</i>: in the latter the words <i>filius patris</i> mean equally <i>the
  son of the father</i>, <i>a son of a father</i>, <i>a son of the
  father</i>, or <i>the son of a father</i>. In M&oelig;so-Gothic and in
  Old Norse, there is an equal absence of the indefinite article; or, at
  any rate, if there be one at all, it is a different word from what occurs
  in English. In these the Greek <span title="tis" class="grk"
  >&tau;&iota;&sigmaf;</span> is expressed by the Gothic root
  <i>sum</i>.</p>

  <p>Now, since it is very evident that, as far as the sense is concerned,
  the words <i>some man</i>, <i>a certain man</i>, and <i>a man</i>, are
  much the same, an exception may be taken to the statement that in Greek
  and M&oelig;so-Gothic there is no indefinite article. It may, in the
  present state of the argument, be fairly said that the words <i>sum</i>
  and <span title="tis" class="grk">&tau;&iota;&sigmaf;</span> are pronouns
  with a certain sense, and that <i>a</i> and <i>an</i> are no more;
  consequently, that in Greek the indefinite article is <span title="tis" class="grk"
  >&tau;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>, in M&oelig;so-Gothic <i>sum</i>, and in
  English <i>a</i> or <i>an</i>. <!-- Page 195 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page195"></a>[195]</span></p>

  <p>A distinction, however, may be made. In the expression <span
  title="anêr tis" class="grk">&#x1F00;&nu;&#x1F75;&rho;
  &tau;&iota;&sigmaf;</span> (<i>anær tis</i>) = <i>a certain man</i>, or
  <i>a man</i>, and in the expression <i>sum mann</i>, the words <i>sum</i>
  and <span title="tis" class="grk">&tau;&iota;&sigmaf;</span> preserve
  their natural and original meaning; whilst in <i>a man</i> and <i>an
  ox</i> the words <i>a</i> and <i>an</i> are used in a secondary sense.
  These words, as is currently known, are one and the same, the <i>n</i>,
  in the form <i>a</i>, being ejected through a euphonic process. They are,
  moreover, the same words with the numeral <i>one</i>; Anglo-Saxon,
  <i>án</i>; Scotch, <i>ane</i>. Now, between the words <i>a man</i> and
  <i>one man</i>, there is a difference in meaning; the first expression
  being the most indefinite. Hence comes the difference between the English
  and M&oelig;so-Gothic expressions. In the one the word <i>sum</i> has a
  natural, in the other, the word <i>an</i> has a secondary power.</p>

  <p>The same reasoning applies to the word <i>the</i>. Compared with <i>a
  man</i>, the words <i>the man</i> are very definite. Compared, however,
  with the words <i>that man</i>, they are the contrary. Now, just as
  <i>an</i> and <i>a</i> have arisen out of the numeral <i>one</i>, so has
  <i>the</i> arisen out of the demonstrative pronoun <i>þæt</i>, or at
  least from some common root. It will be remembered that in Anglo-Saxon
  there was a form <i>þe</i>, undeclined, and common to all the cases of
  all the numbers.</p>

  <p>In no language in its oldest stage is there ever a word giving, in its
  primary sense, the ideas of <i>a</i> and <i>the</i>. As tongues become
  modern, some noun with a <i>similar</i> sense is used to express them. In
  the course of time a change of form takes place, corresponding to the
  change of meaning; <i>e.g.</i>, <i>one</i> becomes <i>an</i>, and
  afterwards <i>a</i>. Then it is that articles become looked upon as
  separate parts of speech, and are dealt with accordingly. No invalidation
  of this statement is drawn from the Greek language. Although the first
  page of the etymology gives us <span title="ho" class="grk"
  >&#x1F41;</span>, <span title="hê" class="grk">&#x1F21;</span>, <span
  title="to" class="grk">&tau;&#x1F78;</span> (<i>ho, hæ, <!-- Page 196
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>[196]</span>to</i>), as
  the definite articles, the corresponding page in the syntax informs us,
  that, in the oldest stage of the language, <span title="ho" class="grk"
  >&#x1F41;</span> (<i>ho</i>) = <i>the</i>, had the power of <span
  title="houtos" class="grk">&omicron;&#x1F57;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  (<i>howtos</i>) = <i>this</i>.</p>

  <p>The origin of the articles seems uniform. In German <i>ein</i>, in
  Danish <i>en</i>, stand to <i>one</i> in the same relation that <i>an</i>
  does. The French <i>un</i>, Italian and Spanish <i>uno</i>, are similarly
  related to <i>unus</i> = <i>one</i>.</p>

  <p>And as, in English, <i>the</i>, in German <i>der</i>, in Danish
  <i>den</i>, come from the demonstrative pronouns, so, in the classical
  languages, are the French <i>le</i>, the Italian <i>il</i> and <i>lo</i>,
  and the Spanish <i>el</i>, derived from the Latin demonstrative
  <i>ille</i>.</p>

  <p>In his "Outlines of Logic," the present writer has given reasons for
  considering the word <i>no</i> (as in <i>no man</i>) an article.</p>

  <p>That <i>the</i>, in expressions like <i>all the more</i>, <i>all the
  better</i>, &amp;c., is no article, has already been shown.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">DIMINUTIVES, AUGMENTATIVES, AND PATRONYMICS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect268">§ 268</a>. Compared with the words <i>lamb</i>,
  <i>man</i>, and <i>hill</i>, the <span class="correction" title="Original reads `works'."
  >words</span> <i>lambkin</i>, <i>mannikin</i>, and <i>hillock</i> convey
  the idea of comparative smallness or diminution. Now, as the word
  <i>hillock</i> = <i>a little hill</i> differs in <i>form</i> from
  <i>hill</i>, we have in English a series of <i>diminutive</i> forms, or
  <i>diminutives</i>.</p>

  <p>The English diminutives may be arranged according to a variety of
  principles. Amongst others:</p>

  <p>1. <i>According to their form.</i>&mdash;The word <i>hillock</i> is
  derived from <i>hill</i>, by the <i>addition</i> of a <i>syllable</i>.
  The word <i>tip</i> is derived from <i>top</i>, by the <i>change</i> of a
  <i>vowel</i>.</p>

  <p>2. <i>According to their meaning.</i>&mdash;In the word <i>hillock</i>
  there is the simple expression of comparative smallness in size. In the
  word <i>doggie</i> for <i>dog</i>, <i>lassie</i> for <i>lass</i>, the
  addition of the <i>-ie</i> makes the word not so much a diminutive as a
  term of tenderness or endearment. The idea of smallness, accompanied,
  perhaps, with that of neatness, generally carries with it the idea of
  approbation; hence, the word <i>clean</i> in English, means, in German,
  <i>little</i> = <i>kleine</i>. The feeling of protection which is
  extended to small objects engenders the notion of endearment.</p>

  <p><a name="sect269">§ 269</a>. The Greek word <span title="meiôsis" class="grk"
  >&mu;&epsilon;&#x1F77;&omega;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>
  (<i>meiôsis</i>) means diminution; the Greek word <span
  title="hupokorisma" class="grk"
  >&#x1F51;&pi;&omicron;&kappa;&#x1F79;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&mu;&alpha;</span>
  (<i>hypokorisma</i>) means <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page198"></a>[198]</span>an endearing expression. Hence we get
  names for the two kinds of diminutives; <i>viz.</i>, the term
  <i>meiotic</i> for the true diminutives, and the term <i>hypocoristic</i>
  for the diminutives of endearment.</p>

  <p>3. <i>According to their historical origin.</i>&mdash;The syllable
  <i>-ock</i>, as in <i>hillock</i>, is of Anglo-Saxon and Gothic origin.
  The <i>-et</i>, as in <i>lancet</i>, is of French and classical
  origin.</p>

  <p>4. <i>According as they affect proper names, or common
  names.</i>&mdash;<i>Hawkin</i>, <i>Perkin</i>, <i>Wilkin</i>, &amp;c. In
  these words we have the diminutives of <i>Hal</i>, <i>Peter</i>,
  <i>Will</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><a name="sect270">§ 270</a>. The diminutive forms of Gothic origin are
  the first to be considered.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Those formed by a change of vowel.</i>&mdash;<i>Tip</i>, from
  <i>top</i>. The relation of the feminine to the masculine is allied to
  the ideas conveyed by many diminutives. Hence in the word <i>kit</i>,
  from <i>cat</i>, it is doubtful whether there be meant a female cat or a
  little cat. <i>Kid</i> is a diminutive form of <i>goat</i>.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Those formed by the addition of a letter or
  letters.</i>&mdash;Of the diminutive characteristics thus formed the
  commonest, beginning from the simpler forms, are</p>

  <p><i>Ie</i>.&mdash;Almost peculiar to the Lowland Scotch; as
  <i>daddie</i>, <i>lassie</i>, <i>minnie</i>, <i>wifie</i>, <i>mousie</i>,
  <i>doggie</i>, <i>boatie</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Ock</i>.&mdash;<i>Bullock</i>, <i>hillock</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Kin</i>.&mdash;<i>Lambkin</i>, <i>mannikin</i>, <i>ladikin</i>,
  &amp;c. As is seen above, common in proper names.</p>

  <p><i>En</i>.&mdash;<i>Chicken</i>, <i>kitten</i>, from <i>cock</i>,
  <i>cat</i>. The notion of diminution, if indeed that be the notion
  originally conveyed, lies not in the <i>-en</i>, but in the vowel. In the
  word <i>chicken</i>, from <i>cock</i>, observe the effect of the small
  vowel on the <i>c</i>.</p>

  <p>The consideration of words like <i>duckling</i>, and <i>gosling</i>,
  is purposely deferred.</p>

  <p>The chief diminutive of classical origin is&mdash; <!-- Page 199
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>[199]</span></p>

  <p><i>Et</i>, as in <i>trumpet</i>, <i>lancet</i>, <i>pocket</i>; the
  word <i>pock</i>, as in <i>meal-pock</i> = <i>a meal-bag</i>, being found
  in the Scottish. From the French <i>-ette</i>, as in <i>caissette</i>,
  <i>poulette</i>.</p>

  <p>The forms <i>-rel</i>, as in <i>cockerel</i>, <i>pickerel</i>, and
  <i>-let</i>, as in <i>streamlet</i>, require a separate consideration.
  The first has nothing to do with the Italian forms <i>acquerella</i> and
  <i>coserella</i>&mdash;themselves, perhaps, of Gothic, rather than of
  classical origin.</p>

  <p>In the Old High-German there are a multitude of diminutive forms in
  <i>-el</i>; as <i>ouga</i> = <i>an eye</i>, <i>ougili</i> = <i>a little
  eye</i>; <i>lied</i> = <i>a song</i>, <i>liedel</i> = <i>a little
  song</i>. This indicates the nature of words like <i>cockerel</i>.</p>

  <p>Even in English the diminutive power of <i>-el</i> can be traced in
  the following words:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Soare</i> = a deer in its third year. <i>Sor-rel</i>&mdash;a deer
  in its second year.&mdash;See "Love's Labour Lost," with the note.</p>

  <p><i>Tiercel</i> = a small sort of hawk, one-third less (<i>tierce</i>)
  than the common kind.</p>

  <p><i>Kantle</i> = <i>small corner</i>, from <i>cant</i> = <i>a
  corner</i>.&mdash;"Henry IV."</p>

  <p><i>Hurdle</i>; in Dutch <i>horde</i>; German, <i>hurde</i>.
  <i>Hording</i>, without the <i>-l</i>, is used in an allied sense by
  builders in English.</p>

  <p>In the words in point we must assume an earlier form, <i>cocker</i>
  and <i>piker</i>, to which the diminutive form <i>-el</i> is affixed. If
  this be true, we have, in English, representatives of the diminutive form
  <i>-el</i> so common in the High Germanic dialects. <i>Wolfer</i> = <i>a
  wolf</i>, <i>hunker</i> = <i>a haunch</i>, <i>flitcher</i> = <i>a
  flitch</i>, <i>teamer</i> = <i>a team</i>, <i>fresher</i> = <i>a
  frog</i>,&mdash;these are north country forms of the present English.</p>

  <p>The termination <i>-let</i>, as in <i>streamlet</i>, seems to be
  double, and to consist of the Gothic diminutive <i>-l</i>, and the French
  diminutive <i>-t</i>. <!-- Page 200 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page200"></a>[200]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect271">§ 271</a>. <i>Augmentatives.</i>&mdash;Compared with
  <i>capello</i> = <i>a hat</i>, the Italian word <i>capellone</i> = <i>a
  great hat</i>, is an augmentative. The augmentative forms, pre-eminently
  common in the Italian language, often carry with them a depreciating
  sense.</p>

  <p>The termination <i>-rd</i> (in Old High German, <i>-hart</i>), as in
  <i>drunkard</i>, <i>braggart</i>, <i>laggard</i>, <i>stinkard</i>,
  carries with it this idea of depreciation. In <i>buzzard</i>, and
  <i>reynard</i>, the name of the fox, it is simply augmentative. In
  <i>wizard</i>, from <i>witch</i>, it has the power of a masculine
  form.</p>

  <p>The termination <i>-rd</i>, taken from the Gothic, appears in the
  modern languages of classical origin: French, <i>vieillard</i>; Spanish,
  <i>codardo</i>. From these we get, at secondhand, the word
  <i>coward</i>.</p>

  <p>The word <i>sweetheart</i> is a derived word of this sort, rather than
  a compound word; since in Old High German and Middle High German, we have
  the corresponding form <i>liebhart</i>. Now the form for <i>heart</i> is
  in German not <i>hart</i>, but <i>herz</i>.</p>

  <p>Words like <i>braggadocio</i>, <i>trombone</i>, <i>balloon</i>, being
  words of foreign origin, prove nothing as to the further existence of
  augmentative forms in English.</p>

  <p><a name="sect272">§ 272</a>.&mdash;<i>Patronymics.</i>&mdash;In the
  Greek language the notion of <i>lineal descent</i>, in other words, the
  relation of the son to the father, is expressed by a particular
  termination; as <span title="Pêleus" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&eta;&lambda;&epsilon;&#x1F7B;&sigmaf;</span> (<i>Peleus</i>), <span
  title="Pêleidês" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&eta;&lambda;&epsilon;&#x1F77;&delta;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>
  (<i>Peleidæs</i>), the son of Peleus. It is very evident that this mode
  of expression is very different from either the English form
  <i>Johnson</i> = <i>the son of John</i>, or the Gaelic <i>MacDonald</i> =
  <i>the son of Donald</i>. In these last-named words, the words <i>son</i>
  and <i>Mac</i> mean the same thing; so that <i>Johnson</i> and
  <i>MacDonald</i> are not <i>derived</i> but <i>compound</i> words. This
  Greek way of expressing descent is peculiar, and the words wherein it
  occurs are classed together by the peculiar name <!-- Page 201 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page201"></a>[201]</span><i>patronymic</i>; from
  <i>patær</i> = <i>a father</i>, and <i>onoma</i> = <i>a name</i>.</p>

  <p>Is there anything in English corresponding to the Greek
  patronymics?</p>

  <p>Not in the <i>present</i> English? There was, however, in the
  Anglo-Saxon.</p>

  <p>In the Anglo-Saxon, the <span class="correction" title="Original reads `terminations'."
  >termination</span> <i>-ing</i> is as truly patronymic as <span
  title="-idês" class="grk">-&#x1F77;&delta;&eta;&sigmaf;</span> in Greek.
  In the Bible-translation the <i>son of Elisha</i> is called
  <i>Elising</i>. In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle occur such genealogies as
  the following:&mdash;<i>Ida wæs Eopping</i>, <i>Eoppa Esing</i>, <i>Esa
  Inging</i>, <i>Inga Angenviting</i>, <i>Angenvit Alocing</i>, <i>Aloc
  Beonocing</i>, <i>Beonoc Branding</i>, <i>Brand Bældæging</i>, <i>Bældæg
  Vódening</i>, <i>Vóden Friðowulfing</i>, <i>Friðowulf Finning</i>,
  <i>Finn Godwulfing</i>, <i>Godwulf Geating</i> = Ida was the son of
  Eoppa, Eoppa of Esa, Esa of Inga, Inga of Angenvit, Angenvit of Aloc,
  Aloc of Beonoc, Beonoc of Brand, Brand of Bældæg, Bældæg of Woden, Woden
  of Friðowulf, Friðowulf of Finn, Finn of Godwulf, Godwulf of
  Geat.&mdash;In Greek, <span title="Ida ên Eoppeidês, Eoppa Êseidês, Êsa Ingeidês, Inga Angenphiteidês" class="grk"

  &amp;c. In the plural number these forms denote the <i>race of</i>; as
  <i>Scyldingas</i> = <i>the Scyldings</i>, or the race of <i>Scyld</i>,
  &amp;c. Edgar Atheling means Edgar of the race of the nobles.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">GENTILE FORMS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect273">§ 273</a>. The only word in the present English that
  requires explanation is the name of the principality <i>Wales</i>.</p>

  <p>1. The form is <i>plural</i>, however much the meaning may be
  <i>singular</i>; so that the <i>-s</i> in <i>Wale-s</i> is the <i>-s</i>

  <p>2. It has grown out of the Anglo-Saxon from <i>wealhas</i> =
  <i>foreigners</i>, from <i>wealh</i> = <i>a foreigner</i>, the name by
  which the Welsh are spoken of by the Germans of England, just as the
  Italians are called Welsh by the Germans of Germany; and just as
  <i>wal-nuts</i> = <i>foreign nuts</i>, or <i>nuces Galliæ</i>.
  <i>Welsh</i> = <i>weall-isc</i> = <i>foreign</i>, and is a derived
  adjective.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE CONNEXION BETWEEN THE NOUN AND VERB, AND ON THE INFLECTION OF THE INFINITIVE MOOD.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect274">§ 274</a>. In order to understand clearly the use of
  the so-called infinitive mood in English, it is necessary to bear in mind
  two facts, one a matter of <i>logic</i>, the other a matter of
  <i>history</i>.</p>

  <p>In the way of <i>logic</i>, the difference between a noun and a verb
  is less marked than it is in the way of <i>grammar</i>.</p>

  <p>Grammatically, the contrast is considerable. The inflection of nouns
  expresses the ideas of sex as denoted by gender, and of relation in place
  as denoted by cases. That of verbs rarely expresses sex, and never
  relations in place. On the other hand, however, it expresses what no noun
  ever does or can express; <i>e.g.</i>, the relation of the agency to the
  individual speaking, by means of <i>person</i>; the time in which acts
  take place, by means of <i>tense</i>; and the conditions of their
  occurrence, by means of <i>mood</i>.</p>

  <p>The idea of <i>number</i> is the only one that, on a superficial view,
  is common to these two important parts of speech.</p>

  <p><a name="sect275">§ 275</a>. Logically, however, the contrast is
  inconsiderable. A noun denotes an object of which either the senses or
  the intellect can take cognizance, and a verb does no more. <i>To
  move</i> = <i>motion</i>, <i>to rise</i> = <i>rising</i>, <i>to err</i> =
  <i>error</i>, <i>to forgive</i> = <i>forgiveness</i>. The only difference
  between the two parts of speech is this, that, whereas a noun <!-- Page
  204 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>[204]</span>may
  express any object whatever, verbs can only express those objects which
  consist in an action. And it is this superadded idea of action that
  superadds to the verb the phenomena of tense, mood, person, and voice; in
  other words, the phenomena of conjugation.</p>

  <p><a name="sect276">§ 276</a>. A noun is a word capable of
  <i>declension</i> only. A verb is a word capable of declension and
  <i>conjugation</i> also. The fact of verbs being declined as well as
  conjugated must be remembered. <i>The participle has the declension of a
  noun adjective, the infinitive mood the declension of a noun substantive.
  Gerunds and supines, in languages where they occur, are only names for
  certain cases of the verb.</i></p>

  <p><a name="sect277">§ 277</a>. Although in all languages the verb is
  equally capable of declension, it is not equally declined. The Greeks,
  for instance, used forms like</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Greek verb declension (no change in form)." title="Greek verb declension (no change in form).">
<tr><td class="nspac"><span title="to phthonein" class="grk">&tau;&#x1F78; &phi;&theta;&omicron;&nu;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&nu;</span></td><td class="nspac">= <i>invidia</i>.</td></tr>

</table>

  <p><a name="sect278">§ 278</a>. Returning, however, to the illustration
  of the substantival character of the so-called infinitive mood, we may
  easily see&mdash;</p>

  <p><span class="grk">&alpha;</span>. That the name of any action may be
  used without any mention of the agent. Thus, we may speak of the simple
  fact of <i>walking</i> or <i>moving</i>, independently of any
  specification of the <i>walker</i> or <i>mover</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="grk">&beta;</span>. That, when actions are spoken of thus
  indefinitely, the idea of either person or number has no place in the
  conception; from which it follows that the so-called infinitive mood must
  be at once impersonal, and without the distinction of singular, dual, and
  plural.</p>

  <p><span class="grk">&gamma;</span>. That, nevertheless, the ideas of
  time and relation in space <i>have</i> place in the conception. We can
  think of <!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page205"></a>[205]</span>a person being <i>in the act of striking a
  blow</i>, of his <i>having been in the act of striking a blow</i>, or of
  his <i>being about to be in the act of striking a blow</i>. We can also
  think of a person being <i>in the act of doing a good action</i>, or of
  his being <i>from the act of doing a good action</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect279">§ 279</a>. This has been written to show that verbs
  of languages in general are as naturally declinable as nouns. What
  follows will show that the verbs of the Gothic languages in particular
  were actually declined, and that fragments of this declension remain in
  the present English.</p>

  <p>The inflection of the verb in its impersonal (or infinitive state)
  consisted, in its fullest form, of three cases, a nominative (or
  accusative), a dative, and a genitive. The genitive is put last, because
  its occurrence in the Gothic languages is the least constant.</p>

  <p>In Anglo-Saxon the nominative (or accusative) ended in <i>-an</i>,
  with a single <i>n</i>.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Anglo-Saxon infinitive: nominative." title="Anglo-Saxon infinitive: nominative.">

<tr><td class="nspac">Syllan</td><td class="nspac">=&nbsp; <i>to give</i></td><td class="nspac">=&nbsp; <i>dare</i>.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>In Anglo-Saxon the dative of the infinitive verb ended in <i>-nne</i>,
  and was preceded by the preposition <i>to</i>.</p>

  <p>The genitive, ending in <i>-es</i>, occurs only in Old High German and
  Modern High German, <i>plâsannes</i>, <i>weinnenes</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect280">§ 280</a>. With these preliminaries we can take a
  clear view of the English infinitives. They exist under two forms, and
  are referable to a double origin.</p>

  <p>1. The <i>independent</i> form.&mdash;This is used after the words
  <i>can</i>, <i>may</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>, and some others, as,
  <i>I can speak</i>, <i>I may go</i>, <i>I shall come</i>, <i>I will
  move</i>. Here there <!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page206"></a>[206]</span>is no preposition, and the origin of the
  infinitive is from the form in <i>-an</i>.</p>

  <p>2. The <i>prepositional</i> form.&mdash;This is used after the
  majority of English verbs, as, <i>I wish to speak</i>, <i>I mean to
  go</i>, <i>I intend to come</i>, <i>I determine to move</i>. Here we have
  the preposition <i>to</i> and the origin of the infinitive is from the
  form <i>-nne</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect281">§ 281</a>. Expressions like <i>to err</i> =
  <i>error</i>, <i>to forgive</i> = <i>forgiveness</i>, in lines like</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"To err is human, to forgive divine,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>are very remarkable. They exhibit the phenomena of a nominative case
  having grown not only out of a dative but out of a dative <i>plus</i> its
  governing preposition.</p>

  <p><a name="sect282">§ 282</a>. Of the divisions of verbs into active and
  passive, transitive and intransitive, unless there be an accompanying
  change of <i>form</i>, etymology takes no cognisance. The forces of the
  auxiliary verbs, and the tenses to which they are equivalent, are also
  points of syntax rather than of etymology.</p>

  <p>Four classes, however, of <i>derived</i> verbs, as opposed to
  <i>simple</i>, especially deserve notice.</p>

  <p>I. Those ending in <i>-en</i>; as <i>soften</i>, <i>whiten</i>,
  <i>strengthen</i>, &amp;c. Here the <i>-en</i> is a derivational affix;
  and not a representative of the Anglo-Saxon infinitive form <i>-an</i>
  (as <i>lufian</i>, <i>bærnan</i> = <i>to love</i>, <i>to burn</i>), and
  the Old English <i>-en</i> (as <i>tellen</i>, <i>loven</i>).</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE PERSONS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect283">§ 283</a>. Compared with the Latin, the Greek, the
  M&oelig;so-Gothic, and almost all the ancient languages, there is, in
  English, in respect to the persons of the verbs, but a very slight amount
  of inflection. This may be seen by comparing the English word <i>call</i>
  with the Latin <i>voco</i>.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Latin and English verb." title="Latin and English verb.">
<tr><td class="spacsingle">&nbsp;</td><td class="spacsingle"><i>Sing.</i></td><td class="rightbsing"><i>Plur.</i></td><td class="spacsingle"><i>Sing.</i></td><td class="spacsingle"><i>Plur.</i></td></tr>

  <p>Here the Latins have different forms for each different person, whilst
  the English have forms for two only; and even of these one
  (<i>callest</i>) is becoming obsolete. With the forms voc-<i>o</i>,
  voc-<i>amus</i>, voc-<i>atis</i>, voc-<i>ant</i>, there is, in the
  current English, nothing correspondent.</p>

  <p>In the word <i>am</i>, as compared with <i>are</i> and <i>art</i>, we
  find a sign of the first person singular.</p>

  <p>In the old forms <i>tellen</i>, <i>weren</i>, &amp;c., we have a sign
  of the plural number.</p>

  <p><a name="sect284">§ 284</a>. In the Modern English, the Old English,
  and the Anglo-Saxon, the peculiarities of our personal inflections are
  very great. This may be seen from the following tables of

  <p><a name="sect285">§ 285</a>. Herein remark; 1. the Anglo-Saxon
  addition of <i>t</i> in the second person singular; 2. the identity in
  form of the three persons of the plural number; 3. the change of
  <i>-að</i> into <i>-en</i> in the Old English plural; 4. the total
  absence of plural forms in the Modern English; 5. the change of the
  <i>th</i> into <i>s</i>, in <i>loveth</i> and <i>loves</i>. These are
  points bearing especially upon the history of the English <!-- Page 212
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212"></a>[212]</span>persons. The
  following points indicate a more general question:</p>

  <p>1. The full form <i>prennames</i> in the newer Old High German, as
  compared with <i>sôkjam</i> in the <i>old</i> M&oelig;so-Gothic.</p>

  <p>2. The appearance of the <i>r</i> in Icelandic.</p>

  <p>3. The difference between the Old Saxon and the Anglo-Saxon in the
  second person singular; the final <i>t</i> being absent in Old Saxon.</p>

  <p><a name="sect286">§ 286</a>. <i>The person in -t.</i>&mdash;The forms

  in <i>t</i>. The reason for this is to be sought in the M&oelig;so-Gothic
  and the Icelandic.</p>

  <p>In those languages the form of the person changes with the tense, and
  the second singular of the præterite tense of one conjugation is, not
  <i>-s</i>, but <i>-t</i>; as M&oelig;so-Gothic, <i>svôr</i> = <i>I

  <p>In these forms there is a slight though natural anomaly. They belong
  to the class of verbs which form their præterite by changing the vowel of
  the present; as <i>sing</i>, <i>sang</i>, &amp;c. Now, all words of this
  sort in Anglo-Saxon formed their second singular præterite, not in
  <i>-st</i>, but in <i>-e</i>; as <i>þú funde</i> = <i>thou foundest</i>,
  <i>þú sunge</i> = <i>thou sungest</i>. The English termination is derived
  from the present. Observe that this applies only to the præterites formed
  by changing the vowel. <i>Thou loved'st</i> is Anglo-Saxon as well as
  English, <i>viz.</i>, <i>þú lufodest</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect288">§ 288</a>. In the northern dialects of the
  Anglo-Saxon the <i>-ð</i> of plurals like <i>lufiað</i> = <i>we love</i>
  becomes <i>-s</i>. In the Scottish this change was still more
  prevalent:</p>

  <p>James I. of England ends nearly all his plurals in <i>-s</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE NUMBERS OF VERBS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect289">§ 289</a>. As compared with the present plural
  forms, <i>we love</i>, <i>ye love</i>, <i>they love</i>, the Anglo-Saxons
  had the truly plural forms, <i>we lufiað</i>, <i>ge lufiað</i>, <i>hi
  lufiað</i>. The Old English also had a true plural inflection <i>we
  loven</i>, <i>ye loven</i>, <i>they loven</i>. The present English wants
  both the form in <i>-en</i>, and the form in <i>-að</i>. In other words,
  the Anglo-Saxon and the Old English have a plural <i>personal</i>
  characteristic, whilst the Modern English has nothing to correspond with
  it.</p>

  <p><a name="sect290">§ 290</a>. In the forms <i>luf-iað</i>, and
  <i>lov-en</i>, the change from singular to plural is made by adding a
  syllable; but there is no reason against the inflection running
  thus&mdash;<i>I love</i>, <i>thou lovest</i>, <i>he loves</i>; <i>we
  lave</i>, <i>ye lave</i>, <i>they lave</i>; in other words, there is no
  reason against the <i>vowel</i> of the root being changed, just as is the
  case with the form <i>speak, spoke</i>; <i>fall, fell</i>.</p>

  <p>Now, in Anglo-Saxon, with a great number of verbs such a plural
  inflection not only actually takes place, but takes place most regularly.
  It takes place, however, in the past tense only. And this is the case in
  all the Gothic languages as well as in Anglo-Saxon. Amongst the rest,

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON TENSES IN GENERAL.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect293">§ 293</a>. The nature of tenses in general is best
  exhibited by reference to the Greek; since in that language they are more
  numerous, and more strongly marked than elsewhere.</p>

  <p><i>I strike</i>, <i>I struck</i>.&mdash;Of these words, the first
  implies an action taking place at the time of speaking, the second marks
  an action that has already taken place.</p>

  <p>These two notions of present and of past time, being expressed by a
  change of form, are true tenses. If there were no change of form, there
  would be no change of tense. They are the only true tenses in our
  language. In <i>I was beating</i>, <i>I have beaten</i>, <i>I had
  beaten</i>, and <i>I shall beat</i>, a difference of time is expressed;
  but as it is expressed by <i>a combination of words</i>, and not <i>by a
  change of form</i>, no true tenses are constituted.</p>

  <p><a name="sect294">§ 294</a>. In Greek the case is different. <span
  title="Tuptô" class="grk">&Tau;&#x1F7B;&pi;&tau;&omega;</span> (typtô) =
  <i>I beat</i>; <span title="etupton" class="grk"
  >&#x1F14;&tau;&upsilon;&pi;&tau;&omicron;&nu;</span> (etypton) = <i>I was
  beating</i>; <span title="tupsô" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F7B;&psi;&omega;</span> (typsô) = <i>I shall beat</i>; <span
  title="etupsa" class="grk">&#x1F14;&tau;&upsilon;&psi;&alpha;</span>
  (etypsa) = <i>I beat</i>; <span title="tetupha" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F73;&tau;&upsilon;&phi;&alpha;</span> (tetyfa) = <i>I have
  beaten</i>; <span title="etetuphein" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&tau;&epsilon;&tau;&#x1F7B;&phi;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</span>
  (etetyfein) = <i>I had beaten</i>. In these words we have, of the same
  mood, the same voice, and the same conjugation, six different tenses;
  whereas, in English, there are but two. The forms <span title="tetupha" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F73;&tau;&upsilon;&phi;&alpha;</span> and <span title="etupsa" class="grk"
  >&#x1F14;&tau;&upsilon;&psi;&alpha;</span> are so strongly marked, that
  we recognise them wheresoever they occur. The first is formed by a
  reduplication of the initial <span class="grk">&tau;</span>, and,
  consequently, may <!-- Page 218 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page218"></a>[218]</span>be called the reduplicate form. As a tense
  it is called the perfect. In the form <span title="etupsa" class="grk"
  >&#x1F14;&tau;&upsilon;&psi;&alpha;</span> an <span
  class="grk">&epsilon;</span> is prefixed, and an <span
  class="grk">&sigma;</span> is added. In the allied language of Italy the
  <span class="grk">&epsilon;</span> disappears, whilst the <span
  class="grk">&sigma;</span> (<i>s</i>) remains. <span title="Etupsa" class="grk"
  >&#x1F1C;&tau;&upsilon;&psi;&alpha;</span> is said to be an aorist tense.
  <i>Scripsi</i> is to <i>scribo</i> as <span title="etupsa" class="grk"
  >&#x1F14;&tau;&upsilon;&psi;&alpha;</span> is to <span title="tuptô" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F7B;&pi;&tau;&omega;</span>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect295">§ 295</a>. Now in the Latin language a confusion
  takes place between these two tenses. Both forms exist. They are used,
  however, indiscriminately. The aorist form has, besides its own, the
  sense of the perfect. The perfect has, besides its own, the sense of the
  aorist. In the following pair of quotations, <i>vixi</i>, the aorist
  form, is translated <i>I have lived</i>, while <i>tetigit</i>, the
  perfect form, is translated <i>he touched</i>.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Vixi</i>, et quem dederat cursum Fortuna peregi;</p>
      <p>Et nunc magna mei sub terras ibis imago.&mdash;<i>Æn.</i> iv.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Ut primum alatis <i>tetigit</i> magalia plantis.&mdash;<i>Æn.</i> iv.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><a name="sect296">§ 296</a>. When a difference of form has ceased to
  express a difference of meaning, it has become superfluous. This is the
  case with the two forms in question. One of them may be dispensed with;
  and the consequence is, that, although in the Latin language both the
  perfect and the aorist forms are found, they are, with few exceptions,
  never found in the same word. Wherever there is the perfect, the aorist
  is wanting, and <i>vice versâ</i>. The two ideas <i>I have struck</i> and
  <i>I struck</i> are merged into the notion of past time in general, and
  are expressed by one of two forms, sometimes by that of the Greek
  perfect, and sometimes by that of the Greek aorist. On account of this
  the grammarians have cut down the number of Latin tenses to <i>five</i>;
  forms like <i>cucurri</i> and <i>vixi</i> being dealt with as one and the
  same tense. The true view is, that in <i>curro</i> the aorist form is
  replaced by the perfect, and in <i>vixi</i> the perfect form is replaced
  by the aorist. <!-- Page 219 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page219"></a>[219]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect297">§ 297</a>. In the <i>present</i> English there is no
  undoubted perfect or reduplicate form. The form <i>moved</i> corresponds
  in meaning not with <span title="tetupha" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F73;&tau;&upsilon;&phi;&alpha;</span> and <i>momordi</i>, but
  with <span title="etupsa" class="grk"
  >&#x1F14;&tau;&upsilon;&psi;&alpha;</span> and <i>vixi</i>. Its sense is
  that of <span title="etupsa" class="grk"
  >&#x1F14;&tau;&upsilon;&psi;&alpha;</span>, and not that of <span
  title="tetupha" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F73;&tau;&upsilon;&phi;&alpha;</span>. The notion given by
  <span title="tetupha" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F73;&tau;&upsilon;&phi;&alpha;</span> we express by the
  circumlocution <i>I have beaten</i>. We have no such form as
  <i>bebeat</i> or <i>memove</i>. In the M&oelig;so-Gothic, however, there
  was a true reduplicate form; in other words, a perfect tense as well as
  an aorist. It is by the possession of this form that the verbs of the
  first six conjugations are characterized.</p>

  <p>In M&oelig;so-Gothic, as in Latin, the perfect forms have, besides
  their own, an aorist sense, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

  <p>In M&oelig;so-Gothic, as in Latin, few (if any) words are found in
  both forms.</p>

  <p>In M&oelig;so-Gothic, as in Latin, the two forms are dealt with as a
  single tense; <i>láilô</i> being called the præterite of <i>láia</i>, and
  <i>svôr</i> the præterite of <i>svara</i>. The true view, however, is
  that in M&oelig;so-Gothic, as in Latin, there are two past tenses, each
  having a certain latitude of meaning, and each, in certain words,
  replacing the other.</p>

  <p>The reduplicate form, in other words, the perfect tense, is current in
  none of the Gothic languages except the <!-- Page 220 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page220"></a>[220]</span>M&oelig;so-Gothic. A
  trace of it is said to be found in the Anglo-Saxon of the seventh century
  in the word <i>heht</i>, which is considered to be <i>hê-ht</i>, the
  M&oelig;so-Gothic <i>háiháit</i>, <i>vocavi</i>. <i>Did</i> from
  <i>do</i> is also considered to be a reduplicate form.</p>

  <p><a name="sect298">§ 298</a>. In the English language the tense
  corresponding with the Greek aorist and the Latin forms like <i>vixi</i>,
  is formed after two modes; 1, as in <i>fell</i>, <i>sang</i>, and
  <i>took</i>, from <i>fall</i>, <i>sing</i>, and <i>take</i>, by changing
  the vowel of the present: 2, as in <i>moved</i> and <i>wept</i>, from
  <i>move</i> and <i>weep</i>, by the addition of <i>-d</i> or <i>-t</i>;
  the <i>-d</i> or <i>-t</i> not being found in the original word, but
  being a fresh element added to it. In forms, on the contrary, like
  <i>sang</i> and <i>fell</i>, no addition being made, no new element
  appears. The vowel, indeed, is changed, but nothing is added. Verbs,
  then, of the first sort, may be said to form their præterites out of
  themselves; whilst verbs of the second sort require something from
  without. To speak in a metaphor, words like <i>sang</i> and <i>fell</i>
  are comparatively independent. Be this as it may, the German grammarians
  call the tenses formed by a change of vowel the <i>strong</i> tenses, the
  <i>strong</i> verbs, the <i>strong</i> conjugation, or the <i>strong</i>
  order; and those formed by the addition of <i>d</i> or <i>t</i>, the
  <i>weak</i> tenses, the <i>weak</i> verbs, the <i>weak</i> conjugation,
  or the <i>weak</i> order. <i>Bound</i>, <i>spoke</i>, <i>gave</i>,
  <i>lay</i>, &amp;c., are <i>strong</i>; <i>moved</i>, <i>favoured</i>,
  <i>instructed</i>, &amp;c., are <i>weak</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE STRONG TENSES.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect299">§ 299</a>. The strong præterites are formed from the
  present by changing the vowel, as <i>sing</i>, <i>sang</i>; <i>speak</i>,
  <i>spoke</i>.</p>

  <p>In Anglo-Saxon, several præterites change, in their plural, the vowel
  of their singular; as</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Vowel in Anglo-Saxon præterite." title="Vowel in Anglo-Saxon præterite.">
<tr><td class="rightbsing">Ic s<i>a</i>ng, <i>I sang</i>.</td><td class="spacsingle">We s<i>u</i>ngon, <i>we sung</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="rightbsing">þu s<i>u</i>nge, <i>thou sungest</i>. &nbsp;</td><td class="spacsingle">Ge s<i>u</i>ngon, <i>ye sung</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="rightbsing">He s<i>a</i>ng, <i>he sang</i>.</td><td class="spacsingle">Hi s<i>u</i>ngon, <i>they sung</i>.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The bearing of this fact upon the præterites has already been
  indicated. In a great number of words we have a double form, as
  <i>ran</i> and <i>run</i>, <i>sang</i> and <i>sung</i>, <i>drank</i> and
  <i>drunk</i>, &amp;c. One of these forms is derived from the singular,
  and the other from the plural.</p>

  <p>In cases where but one form is preserved, that form is not necessarily
  the singular; indeed, it is often the plural;&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Ic
  f<i>a</i>nd, <i>I found</i>, we f<i>u</i>ndon, <i>we found</i>, are the
  Anglo-Saxon forms. Now the present word <i>found</i> comes, not from the
  singular <i>fand</i>, but from the plural <i>fundon</i>; although in the
  Lowland Scotch dialect and in the old writers, the <i>singular</i> form
  occurs;</p>

  <p>and form their præterite by means of a similar change, <i>i.e.</i>, by
  changing the sound of the <i>ee</i> in <i>feet</i> (spelt <i>ea</i>) into
  that of the <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>; viewed thus, the irregularity is
  less than it appears to be at first sight.</p>

  <p>Again, <i>tread</i> is pronounced <i>tredd</i>, but many provincial
  speakers say <i>treed</i>, and so said the Anglo-Saxons, whose form was
  <i>ic trede</i> = <i>I tread</i>. Their præterite was <i>træd</i>. This
  again subtracts from the apparent irregularity.</p>

  <p>Instances of this kind may be multiplied; the whole question, however,
  of the conjugation of the <i>strong verbs</i> is best considered after
  the perusal of the next chapter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE WEAK TENSES.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect304">§ 304</a>. The præterite tense of the weak verbs is
  formed by the addition of <i>-d</i> or <i>-t</i>.</p>

  <p>If necessary, the syllable <i>-ed</i> is substituted for
  <i>-d</i>.</p>

  <p>The current statement that the syllable <i>-ed</i>, rather than the
  letter <i>-d</i> is the sign of the præterite tense, is true only in
  regard to the written language. In <i>stabbed</i>, <i>moved</i>,
  <i>bragged</i>, <i>whizzed</i>, <i>judged</i>, <i>filled</i>,
  <i>slurred</i>, <i>slammed</i>, <i>shunned</i>, <i>barred</i>,
  <i>strewed</i>, the <i>e</i> is a point of spelling only. In
  <i>language</i>, except in declamation, there is no second vowel sound.
  The <i>-d</i> comes in immediate contact with the final letter of the
  original word, and the number of syllables remains the same as it was
  before. We say <i>stabd</i>, <i>môved</i>, <i>bragd</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><a name="sect305">§ 305</a>. When, however, the original word ends in
  <i>-d</i> or <i>-t</i>, as <i>slight</i> or <i>brand</i>, then, and then
  only is there the real addition of the syllable <i>-ed</i>; as in
  <i>slighted</i>, <i>branded</i>.</p>

  <p>This is necessary, since the combinations <i>slightt</i> and
  <i>brandd</i> are unpronounceable.</p>

  <p>Whether the addition be <i>-d</i> or <i>-t</i> depends upon the
  flatness or sharpness of the preceding letter.</p>

  <p>After <i>b</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>th</i> (as in <i>clothe</i>), <i>g</i>,
  or <i>z</i>, the addition is <i>-d</i>. This is a matter of necessity. We
  say <i>stabd</i>, <i>môvd</i>, <i>clôthd</i>, <i>braggd</i>,
  <i>whizzd</i>, because <i>stabt</i>, <i>môvt</i>, <i>clotht</i>,
  <i>braggt</i>, <i>whizzt</i>, are unpronounceable.</p>

  <p>After <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>y</i>, or a
  vowel, the addition is also <!-- Page 227 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page227"></a>[227]</span><i>-d</i>. This is the <i>habit</i> of the
  English language. <i>Filt</i>, <i>slurt</i>, <i>strayt</i>, &amp;c., are
  as pronounceable as <i>filld</i>, <i>slurrd</i>, <i>strayd</i>, &amp;c.
  It is the habit, however, of the English language to prefer the latter
  forms.</p>

  <p>All this, as the reader has probably observed, is merely the reasoning
  concerning the <i>s</i>, in words like <i>father's</i>, &amp;c., applied
  to another letter and to another part of speech.</p>

  <p><a name="sect306">§ 306</a>. The verbs of the weak conjugation fall
  into three classes.</p>

  <p>I. In the first there is the simple addition of <i>-d</i>, <i>-t</i>,
  or <i>-ed</i>.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Addition of -d, etc." title="Addition of -d, etc.">
<tr><td class="rightbsing">Serve, served.</td><td class="spacsingle">Dip, dipped (<i>dipt</i>).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="rightbsing">Cry, cried.</td><td class="spacsingle">Slip, slipped (<i>slipt</i>).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="rightbsing">Betray, betrayed.</td><td class="spacsingle">Step, stepped (<i>stept</i>).</td></tr>

  <p>To this class belong the remarkable præterites of the verbs
  <i>seek</i>, <i>beseech</i>, <i>catch</i>, <i>teach</i>, <i>bring</i>,
  <i>think</i>, and <i>buy</i>, <i>viz.</i>, <i>sought</i>,
  <i>besought</i>, <i>caught</i>, <i>taught</i>, <i>brought</i>,
  <i>thought</i>, and <i>bought</i>. In all these, the final consonant is
  either <i>g</i> or <i>k</i>, or else a sound allied to those mutes. When
  the tendency of these sounds to become <i>h</i> and <i>y</i>, as well as
  to undergo farther changes, is remembered, the forms in point cease to
  seem anomalous. In <i>wrought</i>, from <i>work</i>, there is a
  transposition. In <i>laid</i> and <i>said</i> the present forms make a
  show of regularity which they have not. The true original forms should be
  <i>legde</i> and <i>sægde</i>, the infinitives being <i>lecgan</i>,
  <i>secgan</i>. In these words the <i>i</i> represents the semivowel
  <i>y</i>, into which the original <i>g</i> was changed. The Anglo-Saxon
  forms of the other words are as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p><a name="sect309">§ 309</a>. Out of the three classes into which the
  weak verbs in Anglo-Saxon are divided, only one takes a vowel before the
  <i>d</i> or <i>t</i>. The other two add the syllables <i>-te</i> or
  <i>-de</i>, to the last letter of the original word. The vowel that, in
  one out of the three Anglo-Saxon classes, precedes <i>d</i> is <i>o</i>.
  Thus we have <i>lufian</i>, <i>lufode</i>; <i>clypian</i>,
  <i>clypode</i>. In the other two classes the forms are respectively
  <i>bærnan</i>, <i>bærnde</i>; and <i>tellan</i>, <i>tealde</i>, no vowel
  being found. The <i>participle</i>, however, as stated above, ended, not
  in <i>-de</i> or <i>-te</i>, but in <i>-d</i> or <i>-t</i>; and in two
  out of the three classes it was preceded by a vowel; the vowel being
  <i>e</i>,&mdash;<i>gelufod</i>, <i>bærned</i>, <i>geteald</i>. Now in
  those conjugations where no vowel preceded the <i>d</i> of the præterite,
  and where the original word ended in <i>-d</i> or <i>-t</i>, a
  difficulty, which has already been indicated, arose. To add the sign of
  the præterite to a word like <i>eard-ian</i> (<i>to dwell</i>) was an
  easy matter, inasmuch as <i>eardian</i> was a word belonging to the first
  class, and in the first class the præterite was formed in <i>-ode</i>.
  Here the vowel <i>o</i> kept the two <i>d</i>'s from coming in contact.
  With words, however, like <i>métan</i> and <i>sendan</i>, this was not
  the case. Here no vowel intervened; so that the natural præterite forms
  were <i>met-te</i>, <i>send-de</i>, combinations wherein one of the
  letters ran every chance of being dropped in the pronunciation. Hence,
  with the exception of the verbs in the first class, words ending in
  <i>-d</i> or <i>-t</i> in the root admitted no additional <i>d</i> or
  <i>t</i> in the præterite. This difficulty, existing in the present
  English as it existed in the Anglo-Saxon, modifies the præterites of most
  words ending in <i>-t</i> or <i>-d</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect310">§ 310</a>. In several words there is the actual
  addition of the syllable <i>-ed</i>; in other words <i>d</i> is separated
  from the last letter of the original word by the addition of a vowel; as
  <i>ended</i>, <i>instructed</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><a name="sect311">§ 311</a>. In several words the final <i>-d</i> is
  changed into <i>-t</i>, <!-- Page 230 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page230"></a>[230]</span>as <i>bend</i>, <i>bent</i>; <i>rend</i>,
  <i>rent</i>; <i>send</i>, <i>sent</i>; <i>gild</i>, <i>gilt</i>;
  <i>build</i>, <i>built</i>; <i>spend</i>, <i>spent</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><a name="sect312">§ 312</a>. In several words the vowel of the root is
  changed; as <i>feed</i>, <i>fed</i>; <i>bleed</i>, <i>bled</i>;
  <i>breed</i>, <i>bred</i>; <i>meet</i>, <i>met</i>; <i>speed</i>,
  <i>sped</i>; <i>r&#x113;ad</i>, <i>r&#x115;ad</i>, &amp;c. Words of this
  last-named class cause occasional difficulty to the grammarian. No
  addition is made to the root, and, in this circumstance, they agree with
  the strong verbs. Moreover, there is a change of the vowel. In this
  circumstance also they agree with the strong verbs. Hence with forms like
  <i>fed</i> and <i>led</i> we are in doubt as to the conjugation. This
  doubt we have three means of settling, as may be shown by the word
  <i>beat</i>.</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> <i>By the form of the participle.</i>&mdash;The <i>-en</i>
  in <i>beaten</i> shows that the word <i>beat</i> is strong.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> <i>By the nature of the vowel.</i>&mdash;The weak form of
  <i>to beat</i> would be <i>bet</i>, or <i>be&#x103;t</i>, after the
  analogy of <i>feed</i> and <i>read</i>. By some persons the word is
  pronounced <i>bet</i>, and with those who do so the word is weak.</p>

  <p><i>c.</i> <i>By a knowledge of the older forms.</i>&mdash;The
  Anglo-Saxon form is <i>beáte</i>, <i>beot</i>. There is no such a weak
  form as <i>beáte</i>, <i>bætte</i>. The præterite of <i>sendan</i> is
  <i>sende</i> weak. There is in Anglo-Saxon no such form as <i>sand</i>,
  strong.</p>

  <p>In all this we see a series of expedients for distinguishing the
  præterite form from the present, when the root ends with the same sound
  with which the affix begins.</p>

  <p>The change from a long vowel to a short one, as in <i>feed</i>,
  <i>fed</i>, &amp;c., can only take place where there is a long vowel to
  be changed.</p>

  <p>Where the vowels are short, and, at the same time, the word ends in
  <i>-d</i>, the <i>-d</i> of the present may become <i>-t</i> in the
  præterite. Such is the case with <i>bend</i>, <i>bent</i>.</p>

  <p>When there is no long vowel to shorten, and no <i>-d</i> <!-- Page 231
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>[231]</span>to change into
  <i>-t</i>, the two tenses, of necessity, remain alike; such is the case
  with <i>cut</i>, <i>cost</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><a name="sect313">§ 313</a>. The following verbs form their præterite
  in <i>-t</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <p><a name="sect314">§ 314</a>. Certain <i>so-called</i> irregularities
  may now be noticed.&mdash;<i>Made</i>, <i>had</i>.&mdash;In these words
  there is nothing remarkable but the ejection of a consonant. The
  Anglo-Saxon forms are <i>macode</i> and <i>hæfde</i>, respectively. The
  words, however, in regard to the amount of change, are not upon a
  <i>par</i>. The <i>f</i> in <i>hæfde</i> was probably sounded as
  <i>v</i>. Now <i>v</i> is a letter excessively liable to be ejected,
  which <i>k</i> is not. <i>K</i>, before it is ejected, is generally
  changed into either <i>g</i> or <i>y</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Would</i>, <i>should</i>, <i>could</i>.&mdash;It must not be
  imagined that <i>could</i> is in the same predicament with these words.
  In <i>will</i> and <i>shall</i> the <i>-l</i> is part of the original
  word. This is not the case with <i>can</i>. For the form <i>could</i>,
  see § <a href="#sect331">331</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect315">§ 315</a>. <i>Aught</i>.&mdash;In Anglo-Saxon
  <i>áhte</i>, the præterite of the present form <i>áh</i>, plural
  <i>ágon</i>.&mdash;As late as the time of Elizabeth we find <i>owe</i>
  used for <i>own</i>. The present form <i>own</i> seems to have arisen
  from the plural <i>ágon</i>. <i>Aught</i> is the præterite of the
  Anglo-Saxon <i>áh</i>; <i>owed</i> of the English <i>owe</i> =
  <i>debeo</i>; <i>owned</i> of the English <i>own</i> = <!-- Page 232
  --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page232"></a>[232]</span><i>possideo</i>. The word <i>own</i>, in
  the expression <i>to own to a thing</i>, has a totally different origin.
  It comes from the Anglo-Saxon <i>an</i> (plural, <i>unnon</i>) = <i>I
  give</i>, or <i>grant</i> = <i>concedo</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect316">§ 316</a>. <i>Durst</i>.&mdash;The verb <i>dare</i>
  is both transitive and intransitive. We can say either <i>I dare do such
  a thing</i>, or <i>I dare (challenge) such a man to do it</i>. This, in
  the present tense, is unequivocally correct. In the past the double power
  of the word <i>dare</i> is ambiguous; still it is, to my mind at least,
  allowable. We can certainly say <i>I dared him to accept my
  challenge</i>; and we can, perhaps, say <i>I dared venture on the
  expedition</i>. In this last sentence, however, <i>durst</i> is the
  preferable expression.</p>

  <p>Now, although <i>dare</i> is both transitive and intransitive,
  <i>durst</i> is only intransitive. It never agrees with the Latin word
  <i>provoco</i>; only with the Latin word <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `auedo'."><i>audeo</i></span>. Moreover, the word
  <i>durst</i> has both a present and a past sense. The difficulty which it
  presents consists in the presence of the <i>-st</i>, letters
  characteristic of the second person singular, but here found in all the
  persons alike; as <i>I durst</i>, <i>they durst</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>This has still to be satisfactorily accounted for.</p>

  <p><i>Must</i>.&mdash;A form common to all persons, numbers, and tenses.
  That neither the <i>-s</i> nor the <i>-t</i> are part of the original
  root, is indicated by the Scandinavian form <i>maae</i> (Danish),
  pronounced <i>moh</i>; præterite <i>maatt</i>.</p>

  <p>This form has still to be satisfactorily accounted for.</p>

  <p><i>Wist</i>.&mdash;In its present form a regular præterite from
  <i>wiss</i> = <i>know</i>. The difficulties of this word arise from the
  parallel forms <i>wit</i> (as in <i>to wit</i>), and <i>wot</i> =
  <i>knew</i>. The following are the forms of this peculiar
  word:&mdash;</p>

  <p>In M&oelig;so-Gothic, 1 sing. pres. ind. <i>váit</i>; 2. do., <!--
  Page 233 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page233"></a>[233]</span><i>váist</i>; 1 pl. <i>vitum</i>;
  præterite 1 s. <i>vissa</i>; 2 <i>vissêss</i>; 1 pl. <i>vissêdum</i>.
  From the form <i>váist</i> we see that the second singular is formed
  after the manner of <i>must</i>; that is, <i>váist</i> stands instead of
  <i>váit-t</i>. From the form <i>vissêdum</i> we see that the præterite is
  not strong, but weak; therefore that <i>vissa</i> is euphonic for
  <i>vista</i>.</p>

  <p>In Anglo-Saxon.&mdash;<i>Wât</i>, <i>wást</i>, <i>witon</i>,
  <i>wiste</i>, and <i>wisse</i>, <i>wiston</i>.&mdash;Hence the double
  forms, <i>wiste</i>, and <i>wisse</i>, verify the statement concerning
  the M&oelig;so-Gothic <i>vissa</i>.</p>

  <p>In Icelandic.&mdash;<i>Veit</i>, <i>veizt</i>, <i>vitum</i>,
  <i>vissi</i>. Danish <i>ved</i>, <i>vide</i>, <i>vidste</i>. Observe the
  form <i>vidste</i>; since, in it, the <i>d</i> of the root (in spelling,
  at least) is preserved. The <i>t</i> of the Anglo-Saxon <i>wiste</i> is
  the <i>t</i>, not of the root, but of the inflection.</p>

  <p>In respect to the four forms in question, <i>viz.</i>, <i>wit</i>,
  <i>wot</i>, <i>wiss</i>, <i>wisst</i>, the first seems to be the root;
  the second a strong præterite regularly formed, but used (like <span
  title="oida" class="grk">&omicron;&#x1F36;&delta;&alpha;</span> in Greek)
  with a present sense; the third a weak præterite, of which the <i>-t</i>
  has been ejected by a euphonic process, used also with a present sense;
  the fourth is a second singular from <i>wiss</i> after the manner of
  <i>wert</i> from <i>were</i>, a second singular from <i>wit</i> after the
  manner of <i>must</i>, a secondary præterite from <i>wiss</i>, or
  finally, the form <i>wisse</i>, anterior to the operation of the euphonic
  process that ejected the <i>-t</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect317">§ 317</a>. In the phrase <i>this will do</i> =
  <i>this will answer the purpose</i>, the word <i>do</i> is wholly
  different from the word <i>do</i>, meaning <i>to act</i>. In the first
  case it is equivalent to the Latin <i>valere</i>; in the second to the
  Latin <i>facere</i>. Of the first the Anglo-Saxon inflection is
  <i>deáh</i>, <i>dugon</i>, <i>dohte</i>, <i>dohtest</i>, &amp;c. Of the
  second it is <i>dó</i>, <i>doð</i>, <i>dyde</i>, &amp;c. I doubt whether
  the præterite <i>did</i>, as equivalent to <i>valebat</i> = <i>was good
  for</i>, is correct. In the phrase <i>it did for him</i> = <i>it finished
  him</i>, either meaning may be allowed. <!-- Page 234 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>[234]</span></p>

  <p>In the present Danish they write <i>duger</i>, but say <i>duer</i>: as
  <i>duger et noget?</i> = <i>Is it worth anything?</i> pronounced <i>dooer
  deh note?</i> This accounts for the ejection of the <i>g</i>. The
  Anglo-Saxon form <i>deáh</i> does the same.</p>

  <p><a name="sect318">§ 318</a>. <i>Mind&mdash;mind and do so and
  so</i>.&mdash;In this sentence the word <i>mind</i> is wholly different
  from the noun <i>mind</i>. The Anglo-Saxon forms are <i>geman</i>,
  <i>gemanst</i>, <i>gemunon</i>, without the <i>-d</i>; this letter
  occurring only in the præterite tense (<i>gemunde</i>, <i>gemundon</i>),
  of which it is the sign. <i>Mind</i> is, then, a præterite form with a
  present sense; whilst <i>minded</i> (as in <i>he minded his business</i>)
  is an instance of excess of inflection; in other words, it is a præterite
  formed from a præterite.</p>

  <p><a name="sect319">§ 319</a>. <i>Yode</i>.&mdash;The obsolete præterite
  of <i>go</i>, now replaced by <i>went</i>, the præterite of <i>wend</i>.
  Regular, except that the initial <i>g</i> has become <i>y</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect320">§ 320</a>. <i>Did</i>.&mdash;See § <a
  href="#sect317">317</a>.</p>

  <p><i>Did</i>, from <i>do</i> = <i>facio</i>, is a <i>strong</i> verb.
  This we infer from the form of its participle <i>done</i>.</p>

  <p>If so the final <i>-d</i> is not the same as the <i>-d</i> in
  <i>moved</i>. What is it? There are good grounds for believing that in
  the word <i>did</i> we have a single instance of the old <i>reduplicate
  præterite</i>. If so, it is the latter <i>d</i> which is radical, and the
  former which is inflectional.</p>

  <p><a name="sect322">§ 322</a>. Respecting the <i>strong</i> verb, the
  following general statements may be made:</p>

  <p>1. Many strong verbs become weak; whilst no weak verb ever becomes
  strong.</p>

  <p>2. All the strong verbs are of Saxon origin. None are classical. <!--
  Page 237 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237"></a>[237]</span></p>

  <p>3. The greater number of them are strong throughout the Gothic
  tongues.</p>

  <p>4. No new word is ever, upon its importation, inflected according to
  the strong conjugation. It is always weak. As <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `nearly'.">early</span> as <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1085, the French word <i>adouber</i> = <i>to
  dub</i>, was introduced into English. Its præterite was
  <i>dubbade</i>.</p>

  <p>5. All derived words are inflected weak. The intransitive forms
  <i>drink</i> and <i>lie</i>, are strong; the transitive forms
  <i>drench</i> and <i>lay</i>, are weak.</p>

  <p>This shows that the division of verbs into <i>weak</i> and
  <i>strong</i> is a truly natural one.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">DEFECTIVENESS AND IRREGULARITY.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect323">§ 323</a>. The distinction between irregularity and
  defectiveness has been foreshadowed. It is now more urgently insisted
  on.</p>

  <p>The words that have hitherto served as illustrations are the personal
  pronouns <i>I</i> or <i>me</i>, the adjectives <i>good</i>,
  <i>better</i>, and <i>best</i>.</p>

  <p>The view of these words was as follows; <i>viz.</i>, that none of them
  were <i>irregular</i>, but that they were all <i>defective</i>. <i>Me</i>
  wanted the nominative, <i>I</i> the oblique cases. <i>Good</i> was
  without a comparative, <i>better</i> and <i>best</i> had no positive
  degree.</p>

  <p>Now <i>me</i> and <i>better</i> may be said to make good the
  defectiveness of <i>I</i> and <i>good</i>; and <i>I</i> and <i>good</i>
  may be said to replace the forms wanting in <i>me</i> and <i>better</i>.
  This gives us the principle of <i>compensation</i>. To introduce a new
  term, <i>I</i> and <i>me</i>, <i>good</i> and <i>better</i>, may be said
  to be <i>complementary</i> to each other.</p>

  <p>What applies to nouns applies to verbs also. <i>Go</i> and <i>went</i>
  are not irregularities. <i>Go</i> is defective in the past tense.
  <i>Went</i> is without a present. The two words, however, compensate
  their mutual deficiencies, and are complementary to each other.</p>

  <p>The distinction between defectiveness and irregularity, is the first
  instrument of criticism for coming to true <!-- Page 239 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page239"></a>[239]</span>views concerning the
  proportion of the regular and irregular verbs.</p>

  <p><a name="sect324">§ 324</a>. The second instrument of criticism in
  determining the irregular verbs, is the meaning that we attach to the
  term.</p>

  <p>It is very evident that it is in the power of the grammarian to raise
  the number of etymological irregularities to any amount, by narrowing the
  definition of the word <i>irregular</i>; in other words, by framing an
  exclusive rule. The current rule of the common grammarians <span
  class="correction" title="`is' missing in original.">is</span> that the
  præterite is formed <i>by the addition of</i> <i>-t</i>, or <i>-d</i>, or
  <i>-ed</i>; a position sufficiently exclusive; since it proscribes not
  only the whole class of strong verbs, but also words like <i>bent</i> and
  <i>sent</i>, where <i>-t</i> exists, but where it does not exist as <i>an
  addition</i>. The regular forms, it may be said, should be <i>bended</i>
  and <i>sended</i>.</p>

  <p>Exclusive, however, as the rule in question is, it is plain that it
  might be made more so. The regular forms might, by the <i>fiat</i> of a
  rule, be restricted to those in <i>-d</i>. In this case words like
  <i>wept</i> and <i>burnt</i> would be added to the already numerous list
  of irregulars.</p>

  <p>Finally, a further limitation might be made, by laying down as a rule
  that no word was regular, unless it ended in <i>-ed</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect325">§ 325</a>. Thus much concerning the modes of making
  rules exclusive, and, consequently, of raising the amount of
  irregularities. This is the last art that the philosophic grammarian is
  ambitious of acquiring. True etymology <i>reduces</i> irregularity; and
  that by making the rules of grammar, not exclusive, but general. <i>The
  quantum of irregularity is in the inverse proportion to the generality of
  our rules.</i> In language itself there is no irregularity. The word
  itself is only another name for our ignorance of the processes that
  change words; and, as irregularity <!-- Page 240 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page240"></a>[240]</span>is in the direct
  proportion to the exclusiveness of our rules, the exclusiveness of our
  rules is in the direct proportion to our ignorance of etymological
  processes.</p>

  <p><a name="sect326">§ 326</a>. The explanation of some fresh terms will
  lead us towards the definition of the word <i>irregular</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Vital and obsolete processes.</i>&mdash;The word <i>moved</i> is
  formed from <i>move</i>, by the addition of <i>-d</i>. The addition of
  <i>-d</i> is the process by which the present form is rendered præterite.
  The word <i>fell</i> is formed from <i>fall</i>, by changing <i>a</i>
  into <i>e</i>. The change of vowel is the process by which the present
  form is rendered præterite. Of the two processes the result is the same.
  In what respect do they differ?</p>

  <p>For the sake of illustration, let a new word be introduced into the
  language. Let a præterite tense of it be formed. This præterite would be
  formed, not by changing the vowel, but by adding <i>-d</i>. No <i>new</i>
  verb ever takes a strong præterite. The like takes place with nouns. No
  <i>new</i> substantive would form its plural, like <i>oxen</i> or
  <i>geese</i>, by adding <i>-en</i>, or by changing the vowel. It would
  rather, like <i>fathers</i> and <i>horses</i>, add the lene sibilant.</p>

  <p>Now, the processes that change <i>fall</i>, <i>ox</i> and <i>goose</i>
  into <i>fell</i>, <i>oxen</i>, and <i>geese</i>, inasmuch as they cease
  to operate on the language in its present stage, are <i>obsolete</i>
  processes; whilst those that change <i>move</i> into <i>moved</i>, and
  <i>horse</i> into <i>horses</i>, operating on the language in its present
  stage, are <i>vital</i> processes.</p>

  <p>A definition of the word <i>irregular</i> might be so framed as to
  include all words whose forms could not be accounted for by the vital
  processes. Such a definition would make all the strong verbs
  irregular.</p>

  <p>The very fact of so natural a class as that of the strong <!-- Page
  241 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page241"></a>[241]</span>verbs
  being reduced to the condition of irregulars, invalidates such a
  definition as this.</p>

  <p><a name="sect327">§ 327</a>. <i>Processes of necessity as opposed to
  processes of habit.</i>&mdash;The combinations <i>-pd</i>, <i>-fd</i>,
  <i>-kd</i>, <i>-sd</i>, and some others, are unpronounceable. Hence words
  like <i>step</i>, <i>quaff</i>, <i>back</i>, <i>kiss</i>, &amp;c., take
  after them the sound of <i>-t</i>; <i>stept</i>, <i>quafft</i>, &amp;c.,
  being their præterites, instead of <i>stepd</i>, <i>quaffd</i>. Here the
  change from <i>-d</i> to <i>-t</i> is a matter of necessity. It is not so
  with words like <i>weep</i>, and <i>wept</i>, &amp;c. Here the change of
  vowel is not necessary. <i>Weept</i> might have been said if the habit of
  the language had permitted.</p>

  <p>A definition of the word <i>irregular</i> might be so framed as to
  include all words whose natural form was modified by any euphonic process
  whatever. In this case <i>stept</i> (modified by a process of necessity),
  and <i>wept</i> (modified by a process of habit), would be equally
  irregular.</p>

  <p>A less limited definition might account words regular as long as the
  process by which they are deflected from their natural form was a process
  of necessity. Those, however, which were modified by a process of habit
  it would class with the irregulars.</p>

  <p>Definitions thus limited arise from ignorance of euphonic processes,
  or rather from an ignorance of the generality of their operation.</p>

  <p><a name="sect328">§ 328</a>. <i>Ordinary processes as opposed to
  extraordinary processes.</i>&mdash;The whole scheme of language is
  analogical. A new word introduced into a language takes the forms of its
  cases or tenses, &amp;c., from the forms of the cases or tenses, &amp;c.,
  of the old words. The analogy is extended. Now few forms (if any) are so
  unique as not to have some others corresponding with them; and few
  processes of change are so unique as not to affect more words than one.
  The forms <i>wept</i>, and <i>slept</i>, correspond <!-- Page 242
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242"></a>[242]</span>with each
  other. They are brought about by the same process: <i>viz.</i>, by the
  shortening of the vowel in <i>weep</i> and <i>sleep</i>. The analogy of
  <i>weep</i> is extended to <i>sleep</i>, and <i>vice versâ</i>. Changing
  our expression, a common influence affects both words. The alteration
  itself is the leading fact. The extent of its influence is an instrument
  of classification. When processes affect a considerable number of words,
  they may be called <i>ordinary</i> processes; as opposed to
  <i>extraordinary</i> processes, which affect one or few words.</p>

  <p>When a word stands by itself, with no other corresponding to it, we
  confess our ignorance, and say that it is affected by an extraordinary
  process, by a process peculiar to itself, or by a process to which we
  know nothing similar.</p>

  <p>A definition of the word <i>irregular</i> might be so framed as to
  include all words affected by extraordinary processes; the rest being
  considered regular.</p>

  <p><a name="sect329">§ 329</a>. <i>Positive processes as opposed to
  ambiguous processes.</i>&mdash;The words <i>wept</i> and <i>slept</i> are
  similarly affected. Each is changed from <i>weep</i> and <i>sleep</i>
  respectively; and we know that the process which affects the one is the
  process that affects the other also. Here there is a positive
  process.</p>

  <p>Reference is now made to words of a different sort. The nature of the
  word <i>worse</i> has been explained in the Chapter on the Comparative
  Degree. There the form is accounted for in two ways, of which only one
  can be the true one. Of the two processes, each might equally have
  brought about the present form. Which of the two it was, we are unable to
  say. Here the process is <i>ambiguous</i>.</p>

  <p>A definition of the word <i>irregular</i> might be so framed as to
  include all words affected by ambiguous processes.</p>

  <p><a name="sect330">§ 330</a>. <i>Normal processes as opposed to
  processes of <!-- Page 243 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page243"></a>[243]</span>confusion.</i>&mdash;Let a certain word
  come under class A. Let all words under class A be similarly affected.
  Let a given word come under class A. This word will be affected even as
  the rest of class A is affected. The process affecting, and the change
  resulting, will be normal, regular, or analogical.</p>

  <p>Let, however, a word, instead of really coming under class A, only
  <i>appear</i> to do so. Let it be dealt with accordingly. The analogy
  then is a false one. The principle of imitation is a wrong one. The
  process affecting is a process of confusion.</p>

  <p>Examples of this (a few amongst many) are words like
  <i>songstress</i>, <i>theirs</i>, <i>minded</i>, where the words
  <i>songstr-</i>, <i>their-</i>, <i>mind-</i>, are dealt with as roots,
  which they are not.</p>

  <p>Ambiguous processes, extraordinary processes, processes of
  confusion&mdash;each, or all of these, are legitimate reasons for calling
  words irregular. The practice of etymologists will determine what
  definition is most convenient.</p>

  <p>With extraordinary processes we know nothing about the word. With
  ambiguous processes we are unable to make a choice. With processes of
  confusion we see the analogy, but, at the same time, see that it is a
  false one.</p>

  <p><a name="sect331">§ 331</a>. <i>Could</i>.&mdash;With all persons who
  pronounce the <i>l</i> this word is truly irregular. The Anglo-Saxon form
  is <i>cuðe</i>. The <i>l</i> is inserted by a process of confusion.</p>

  <p><i>Can</i>, <i>cunne</i>, <i>canst</i>, <i>cunnon</i>, <i>cunnan</i>,
  <i>cuðe</i>, <i>cuðon</i>, <i>cuð</i>&mdash;such are the remaining forms
  in Anglo-Saxon. None of them account for the <i>l</i>. The presence of
  the <i>l</i> makes the word <i>could</i> irregular. No reference to the
  allied languages accounts for it.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding this, the presence of the <i>l</i> is accounted for.
  In <i>would</i> and <i>should</i> the <i>l</i> has a proper <!-- Page 244
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244"></a>[244]</span>place. It is
  part of the original words, <i>will</i> and <i>shall</i>. A false analogy
  looked upon <i>could</i> in the same light. Hence a true irregularity;
  <i>provided that the </i><span class="scac">L</span><i> be
  pronounced</i>.</p>

  <p>The <span class="scac">L</span>, however, is pronounced by few, and
  that only in pursuance with the spelling. This reduces the word
  <i>could</i> to an irregularity, not of language, but only of
  orthography.</p>

  <p>That the mere ejection of the <i>-n</i> in <i>can</i>, and that the
  mere lengthening of the vowel, are not irregularities, we learn from a
  knowledge of the processes that convert the Greek <span title="odontos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F40;&delta;&#x1F79;&nu;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  (<i>odontos</i>) into <span title="odous" class="grk"
  >&#x1F40;&delta;&omicron;&#x1F7B;&sigmaf;</span> (<i>odows</i>).</p>

  <p><a name="sect332">§ 332</a>. The verb <i>quoth</i> is truly defective.
  It is found in only one tense, one number, and one person. It is the
  third person singular of the præterite tense. It has the further
  peculiarity of preceding its pronoun. Instead of saying <i>he quoth</i>,
  we say <i>quoth he</i>. In Anglo-Saxon, however, it was not defective. It
  was found in the other tenses, in the other number, and in other moods.
  <i>Ic cweðe</i>, <i>þú cwyst</i>, <i>he cwyð</i>; <i>ic cwæð</i>, <i>þú
  cwæðe</i>, <i>he cwæð</i>, <i>we cwædon</i>, <i>ge cwædon</i>, <i>hi
  cwædon</i>; imperative, <i>cweð</i>; participle, <i>gecweden</i>. In the
  Scandinavian it is current in all its forms. There, however, it means,
  not <i>to speak</i> but to <i>sing</i>. As far as its conjugation goes,
  it is strong. As far as its class goes, it follows the form of
  <i>speak</i>, <i>spoke</i>. Like <i>speak</i>, its Anglo-Saxon form is in
  <i>æ</i>, as <i>cwæð</i>. Like one of the forms of <i>speak</i>, its
  English form is in <i>o</i>, as <i>quoth</i>, <i>spoke</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect333">§ 333</a>. The principle that gives us the truest
  views of the structure of language is that which considers no word
  irregular unless it be affected by either an <i>ambiguous</i> process, or
  by a <i>process of confusion</i>. The words affected by <i>extraordinary
  processes</i> form a provisional class, which a future increase of our
  etymological <!-- Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page245"></a>[245]</span>knowledge may show to be regular.
  <i>Worse</i> and <i>could</i> are the fairest specimens of our
  irregulars. Yet even <i>could</i> is only an irregularity in the written
  language. The printer makes it, and the printer can take it away. Hence
  the class, instead of filling pages, is exceedingly limited.</p>

  <p><a name="sect336">§ 336</a>. The verb substantive is generally dealt
  with as an <i>irregular</i> verb. This is inaccurate. The true notion is
  that the idea of <i>being</i> or <i>existing</i> is expressed by four
  different verbs, each of which is defective in some of its parts. The
  parts, however, that are wanting in one verb, are made up by the
  inflections of one of the others. There is, for example, no præterite of
  the verb <i>am</i>, and no present of the verb <i>was</i>. The absence,
  however, of the present form of <i>was</i> is made up by the word
  <i>am</i>, and the absence of the præterite form of <i>am</i> is made up
  by the word <i>was</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect337">§ 337</a>. <i>Was</i> is defective, except in the

  <p>In the older stages of the Gothic languages the word had both a full
  conjugation and a regular one. In Anglo-Saxon it had an infinitive, a
  participle present, and a participle past. In M&oelig;so-Gothic it was
  inflected throughout with <i>-s</i>; as <i>visa</i>, <i>vas</i>,
  <i>vêsum</i>, <i>visans</i>. In that language it has the power of the
  Latin <i>maneo</i> = <i>to <!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><a name="sect339">§ 339</a>. The line in Milton beginning <i>If thou
  beest he</i>&mdash;(P. L. b. ii.), leads to the notion that the
  antiquated form <i>beest</i> is not indicative, but conjunctive. Such,
  however, is not the case: <i>byst</i> in Anglo-Saxon is indicative, the
  conjunctive form being <i>beó</i>. <i>And every thing that pretty bin</i>
  (Cymbeline).&mdash;Here the word <i>bin</i> is the conjunctive plural, in
  Anglo-Saxon <i>beón</i>; so that the words <i>every thing</i> are to be
  considered equivalent to the plural form <i>all things</i>. The phrase in
  Latin would stand thus, <i>quotquot pulchra sint</i>; in Greek, thus,
  <span title="ha an kala êi" class="grk">&#x1F01; &#x1F02;&nu;
  &kappa;&#x1F71;&lambda;&alpha; &#x1F96;</span>. The <i>indicative</i>
  plural is, in Anglo-Saxon, not <i>beón</i>, but <i>beóð</i> and
  <i>beó</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect340">§ 340</a>. In the "Deutsche Grammatik" it is stated
  that the Anglo-Saxon forms <i>beô</i>, <i>bist</i>, <i>bið</i>,
  <i>beoð</i>, or <i>beó</i>, have not a present but a <i>future</i> sense;
  that whilst <i>am</i> means <i>I am</i>, <i>beó</i> means <i>I shall
  be</i>; and that in the older languages it is only where the form
  <i>am</i> is not found that <i>be</i> has the power of a present form.
  The same root occurs <!-- Page 249 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page249"></a>[249]</span>in the Slavonic and Lithuanic tongues with
  the same power; as, <i>esmi</i> = <i>I am</i>; <i>búsu</i> = <i>I shall
  be</i>, Lithuanic. <i>Esmu</i> = <i>I am</i>; <i>buhshu</i> = <i>I shall
  be</i>, Livonic.&mdash;<i>Jesm</i> = <i>I am</i>; <i>budu</i> = <i>I
  shall be</i>, Slavonic.&mdash;<i>Gsem</i> = <i>I am</i>; <i>budu</i> =
  <i>I shall be</i>, Bohemian. This, however, proves, not that there is in
  Anglo-Saxon a future tense, but that the word <i>beó</i> has a future
  sense. There is no fresh tense where there is no fresh form.</p>

  <p>The following is a specimen of the future power of <i>beón</i> in
  Anglo-Saxon:&mdash;<i>"Hi ne </i>beóð<i> na cílde, soðlice, on domesdæge,
  ac </i>beóð<i> swa micele menn swa swa hi migton beón gif hi full weoxon
  on gewunlicre ylde."</i>&mdash;Ælfric's Homilies. "They <i>will not
  be</i> children, forsooth, on Domesday, but <i>will be</i> as much (so
  muckle) men as they might be if they were full grown (waxen) in customary
  age."</p>

  <p><a name="sect341">§ 341</a>. Now, if we consider the word <i>beón</i>
  like the word <i>weorðan</i> (see § <a href="#sect343">343</a>) to mean
  not so much <i>to be</i> as to <i>become</i>, we get an element of the
  idea of futurity. Things which are <i>becoming anything</i> have yet
  something further to either do or suffer. Again, from the idea of
  futurity we get the idea of contingency, and this explains the
  subjunctive power of <i>be</i>. In English we often say <i>may</i> for
  <i>shall</i>, and the same was done in Anglo-Saxon.</p>

  <p><a name="sect342">§ 342</a>. <i>Am</i>.&mdash;Of this form it should
  be stated that the letter <i>-m</i> is no part of the original word. It
  is the sign of the first person, just as it is in <i>Greek</i>, and
  several other languages.</p>

  <p>It should also be stated, that although the fact be obscured, and
  although the changes be insufficiently accounted for, the forms
  <i>am</i>, <i>art</i>, <i>are</i>, and <i>is</i>, are not, like <i>am</i>
  and <i>was</i>, parts of different words, but forms of one and the same
  word; in other terms, that, although between <i>am</i> and <i>be</i>
  there is no etymological connexion, <!-- Page 250 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page250"></a>[250]</span>there is one between
  <i>am</i> and <i>is</i>. This we collect from the comparison of the
  Indo-European languages.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE PRESENT PARTICIPLE.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect344">§ 344</a>. The present participle, called also the
  active participle and the participle in <i>-ing</i>, is formed from the
  original word by adding <i>-ing</i>; as, <i>move</i>, <i>moving</i>. In
  the older languages the termination was more marked, being <i>-nd</i>.
  Like the Latin participle in <i>-ns</i>, it was originally declined. The
  M&oelig;so-Gothic and Old High German forms are <i>habands</i> and
  <i>hapêntér</i> = <i>having</i>, respectively. The <i>-s</i> in the one
  language, and the <i>-êr</i> in the other, are the signs of the case and
  gender. In the Old Saxon and Anglo-Saxon the forms are <i>-and</i> and
  <i>-ande</i>; as <i>bindand</i>, <i>bindande</i> = <i>binding</i>. In all
  the Norse languages, ancient and modern, the <i>-d</i> is preserved. So
  it is in the Old Lowland Scotch, and in many of the modern provincial
  dialects of England, where <i>strikand</i>, <i>goand</i>, is said for
  <i>striking</i>, <i>going</i>. In Staffordshire, where the <i>-ing</i> is
  pronounced <i>-ingg</i>, there is a fuller sound than that of the current
  English. In Old English the form in <i>-nd</i> is predominant, in Middle
  English the use fluctuates, and in New English the termination
  <i>-ing</i> is universal. In the Scotch of the modern writers we find the
  form <i>-in</i>.</p>

<p><!-- Page 252 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>[252]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect345">§ 345</a>. It has often been remarked that the
  participle is used in many languages as a substantive. This is true in
  Greek,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span title="Ho prassôn" class="grk">&#x1F49; &pi;&rho;&#x1F71;&sigma;&sigma;&omega;&nu;</span> = <i>the actor</i>, when a male.</p>
      <p><span title="Hê prassousa" class="grk">&#x1F29; &pi;&rho;&alpha;&sigma;&sigma;&omicron;&#x1FE6;&sigma;&alpha;</span> = <i>the actor</i>, when a female.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But it is also stated, that, in the English language, the participle
  is used as a substantive in a greater degree than elsewhere, and that it
  is used in several cases and in both numbers, <i>e.g.</i>,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Rising</i> early is healthy,</p>
      <p>There is health <i>in rising</i> early.</p>
      <p>This is the advantage <i>of rising</i> early.</p>
      <p>The <i>risings</i> in the North, &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Some acute remarks of Mr. R. Taylor, in the Introduction to his
  edition of Tooke's "Diversions of Purley," modify this view. According to
  these, the <i>-ing</i> in words like <i>rising</i> is not the <i>-ing</i>
  of the present participle; neither has it originated in the Anglo-Saxon
  <i>-end</i>. It is rather the <i>-ing</i> in words like <i>morning</i>;
  which is anything but a participle of the non-existent verb <i>morn</i>,
  and which has originated in the Anglo-Saxon substantival termination
  <i>-ung</i>. Upon this Rask writes as follows:&mdash;"<i>Gitsung</i>,
  <i>gewilnung</i> = <i>desire</i>; <i>swutelung</i> =
  <i>manifestation</i>; <i>clænsung</i> = <i>a cleansing</i>;
  <i>sceawung</i> = <i>view</i>, <i>contemplation</i>; <i>eorð-beofung</i>
  = <i>an earthquake</i>; <i>gesomnung</i> = <i>an assembly</i>. This
  termination is chiefly used in forming substantives from verbs of the
  first class in <i>-ian</i>; as <i>hálgung</i> = <i>consecration</i>, from
  <i>hálgian</i> = <i>to consecrate</i>. These verbs are all
  feminine."&mdash;"Anglo-Saxon Grammar," p. 107.</p>

  <p>Now, whatever may be the theory of the origin of the termination
  <i>-ing</i> in old phrases like <i>rising early is <!-- Page 253 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page253"></a>[253]</span>healthy</i>, it cannot
  apply to expressions of recent introduction. Here the direct origin in
  <i>-ung</i> is out of the question.</p>

  <p>The view, then, that remains to be taken of the forms in question is
  this:</p>

  <p>1. That the older forms in <i>-ing</i> are substantival in origin, and
  = the Anglo-Saxon <i>-ung</i>.</p>

  <p>2. That the latter ones are <i>irregularly</i> participial, and have
  been formed on a false analogy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE PAST PARTICIPLE.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect346">§ 346</a>. A. <i>The participle in</i> <span
  class="scac">-EN</span>.&mdash;In the Anglo-Saxon this participle was
  declined like the adjectives. Like the adjectives, it is, in the present
  English, undeclined.</p>

  <p>In Anglo-Saxon it always ended in <i>-en</i>, as <i>sungen</i>,
  <i>funden</i>, <i>bunden</i>. In English this <i>-en</i> is often
  wanting, as <i>found</i>, <i>bound</i>; the word <i>bounden</i> being
  antiquated.</p>

  <p>Words where the <i>-en</i> is wanting may be viewed in two lights; 1,
  they may be looked upon as participles that have lost their termination;
  2, they may be considered as præterites with a participial sense.</p>

  <p><a name="sect347">§ 347</a>. <i>Drank</i>, <i>drunk</i>,
  <i>drunken</i>.&mdash;With all words wherein the vowel of the plural
  differs from that of the singular, the participle takes the plural form.
  To say <i>I have drunk</i>, is to use an ambiguous expression; since
  <i>drunk</i> may be either a participle <i>minus</i> its termination, or
  a præterite with a participial sense. To say <i>I have drank</i>, is to
  use a præterite for a participle. To say <i>I have drunken</i>, is to use
  an unexceptional form.</p>

  <p>In all words with a double form, as <i>spake</i> and <i>spoke</i>,
  <i>brake</i> and <i>broke</i>, <i>clave</i> and <i>clove</i>, the
  participle follows the form in <i>o</i>, as <i>spoken</i>, <i>broken</i>,
  <i>cloven</i>. <i>Spaken</i>, <i>braken</i>, <i>claven</i> are impossible
  forms. There are degrees in laxity of language, and to say <i>the spear
  is broke</i> is better than to say <i>the spear is brake</i>. <!-- Page
  255 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page255"></a>[255]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect348">§ 348</a>. As a general rule, we find the participle
  in <i>-en</i> wherever the præterite is strong; indeed, the participle in
  <i>-en</i> may be called the strong participle, or the participle of the
  strong conjugation. Still the two forms do not always coincide. In
  <i>mow</i>, <i>mowed</i>, <i>mown</i>, <i>sow</i>, <i>sowed</i>,
  <i>sown</i>; and several other words, we find the participle strong, and
  the præterite weak. I remember no instances of the converse. This is only
  another way of saying that the præterite has a greater tendency to pass
  from strong to weak than the participle.</p>

  <p><a name="sect349">§ 349</a>. In the Latin language the change from
  <i>s</i> to <i>r</i>, and <i>vice versâ</i>, is very common. We have the
  double forms <i>arbor</i> and <i>arbos</i>, <i>honor</i> and
  <i>honos</i>, &amp;c. Of this change we have a few specimens in English.
  The words <i>rear</i> and <i>raise</i>, as compared with each other, are
  examples. In Anglo-Saxon a few words undergo a similar change in the
  plural number of the strong præterites.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Ceóse, <i>I choose</i>; ceâs, <i>I chose</i>; curon, <i>we chose</i>; gecoren, <i>chosen</i>.</p>
      <p>Forleóse, <i>I lose</i>; forleás, <i>I lost</i>; forluron, <i>we lost</i>; forloren, <i>lost</i>.</p>
      <p>Hreose, <i>I rush</i>; hreás, <i>I rushed</i>; hruron, <i>we rushed</i>; gehroren, <i>rushed</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This accounts for the participial form <i>forlorn</i>, or <i>lost</i>,
  in New High German <i>verloren</i>. In Milton's lines,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i20">&mdash;&mdash; the piercing air</p>
      <p>Burns <i>frore</i>, and cold performs the effect of fire,&mdash;<i>Paradise Lost</i>, b. ii.,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>we have a form from the Anglo-Saxon participle <i>gefroren</i> =
  <i>frozen</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect350">§ 350</a>. B. The <i>participle</i> in <span
  class="scac">-D</span>, <span class="scac">-T</span>, or <span
  class="scac">-ED</span>.&mdash;In the Anglo-Saxon this participle was
  declined like the adjective. Like the adjective, it is, in the present
  English, undeclined. <!-- Page 256 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page256"></a>[256]</span></p>

  <p>In Anglo-Saxon it differed in form from the præterite, inasmuch as it
  ended in <i>-ed</i>, or <i>-t</i>, whereas the præterite ended in
  <i>-ode</i>, <i>-de</i>, or <i>-te</i>: as, <i>lufode</i>, <i>bærnde</i>,
  <i>dypte</i>, præterites; <i>gelufod</i>, <i>bærned</i>, <i>dypt</i>,
  participles.</p>

  <p>As the ejection of the <i>e</i> (in one case final in the other not)
  reduces words like <i>bærned</i> and <i>bærnde</i> to the same form, it
  is easy to account for the present identity of form between the weak
  præterites and the participles in <i>-d</i>: <i>e.g.</i>, <i>I moved</i>,
  <i>I have moved</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><a name="sect351">§ 351</a>. <i>The prefix</i> <span
  class="scac">Y</span>.&mdash;In the older writers, and in works written,
  like Thomson's "Castle of Indolence," in imitation of them, we find
  prefixed to the præterite participle the letter <i>y-</i>, as,
  <i>yclept</i> = <i>called</i>: <i>yclad</i> = <i>clothed</i>:
  <i>ydrad</i> = <i>dreaded</i>.</p>

  <p>The following are the chief facts and the current opinion concerning
  this prefix:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. It has grown out of the fuller forms <i>ge-</i>: Anglo-Saxon,
  <i>ge-</i>: Old Saxon, <i>gi-</i>: M&oelig;so-Gothic, <i>ga-</i>: Old
  High German, <i>ka-</i>, <i>cha-</i>, <i>ga-</i>, <i>ki-</i>,
  <i>gi-</i>.</p>

  <p>2. It occurs in each and all of the Germanic languages of the Gothic
  stock.</p>

  <p>3. It occurs, with a few fragmentary exceptions, in none of the
  Scandinavian languages of the Gothic stock.</p>

  <p>4. In Anglo-Saxon it occasionally indicates a difference of sense; as,
  <i>hâten</i> = <i>called</i>, <i>ge</i>-hâten = <i>promised</i>;
  <i>boren</i> = <i>borne</i>, <i>ge</i>-boren = <i>born</i>.</p>

  <p>5. It occurs in nouns as well as verbs.</p>

  <p>6. Its power, in the case of nouns, is generally some idea of
  <i>association</i>, or <i>collection</i>.&mdash;M&oelig;so-Gothic,
  <i>sinþs</i> = <i>a journey</i>, <i>ga-sinþa</i> = <i>a companion</i>;
  Old High German, <i>perc</i> = <i>hill</i>; <i>ki-perki</i>
  (<i>gebirge</i>) = <i>a range of hills</i>.</p>

  <p>7. But it has also a <i>frequentative</i> power; a frequentative
  power, which is, in all probability, secondary to its collective power;
  since things which recur frequently recur <!-- Page 257 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page257"></a>[257]</span>with a tendency to
  collection or association; Middle High German, <i>ge-rassel</i> =
  <i>rustling</i>; <i>ge-rumpel</i> = <i>c-rumple</i>.</p>

  <p>8. And it has also the power of expressing the possession of a
  quality.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="The verb Am." title="The verb Am.">
<tr><td class="spacsingle"><i>Anglo-Saxon.</i></td><td class="spacsingle"><i>English.</i></td><td class="spacsingle"><i>Anglo-Saxon.</i></td><td class="spacsingle"><i>Latin.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">&nbsp; &nbsp; Feax</td><td class="spacsingle"><i>Hair</i></td><td class="spacsingle">&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Ge</i>-feax</td><td class="spacsingle"><i>Comatus.</i></td></tr>

</table>

  <p>This power is also a collective, since every quality is associated
  with the object that possesses it; <i>a sea with waves</i> = <i>a wavy
  sea</i>.</p>

  <p>9. Hence it is probable that the <i>ga-</i>, <i>ki-</i>, or
  <i>gi-</i>, Gothic, is the <i>cum</i> of Latin languages. Such, at least,
  is Grimm's view, as given in the "Deutsche Grammatik," i. 1016.</p>

  <p>Concerning this, it may be said that it is deficient in an essential
  point. It does not show how the participle past is collective.
  Undoubtedly it may be said that every such participle is in the condition
  of words like <i>ge-feax</i> and <i>ge-heort</i>; <i>i.e.</i>, that they
  imply an association between the object and the action or state. But this
  does not seem to be Grimm's view; he rather suggests that the <i>ge-</i>
  may have been a prefix to verbs in general, originally attached to all
  their forms, but finally abandoned everywhere except in the case of the
  participle.</p>

  <p>The theory of this prefix has yet to assume a satisfactory form.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">COMPOSITION.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect352">§ 352</a>. In the following words, amongst many
  others, we have palpable and indubitable specimens of
  composition&mdash;<i>day-star</i>, <i>vine-yard</i>, <i>sun-beam</i>,
  <i>apple-tree</i>, <i>ship-load</i>, <i>silver-smith</i>, &amp;c. The
  words <i>palpable</i> and <i>indubitable</i> have been used, because in
  many cases, as will be seen hereafter, it is difficult to determine
  whether a word be a true compound or not.</p>

  <p><a name="sect353">§ 353</a>. Now, in each of the compounds quoted
  above, it may be seen that it is the second word which is qualified, or
  defined, by the first, and that it is not the first which is qualified,
  or defined, by the second. Of <i>yards</i>, <i>beams</i>, <i>trees</i>,
  <i>loads</i>, <i>smiths</i>, there may be many sorts, and, in order to
  determine what <i>particular</i> sort of <i>yard</i>, <i>beam</i>,
  <i>tree</i>, <i>load</i>, or <i>smith</i>, may be meant, the words
  <i>vine</i>, <i>sun</i>, <i>apple</i>, <i>ship</i>, and <i>silver</i>,
  are prefixed. In compound words it is the <i>first</i> term that defines
  or particularises the <i>second</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect354">§ 354</a>. That the idea given by the word
  <i>apple-tree</i> is not referable to the words <i>apple</i> and
  <i>tree</i>, irrespective of the order in which they occur, may be seen
  by reversing the position of them. The word <i>tree-apple</i>, although
  not existing in the language, is as correct a word as <i>thorn-apple</i>.
  In <i>tree-apple</i>, the particular sort of <i>apple</i> meant is
  denoted by the word <i>tree</i>, and if there <!-- Page 259 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page259"></a>[259]</span>were in our gardens
  various sorts of plants called <i>apples</i>, of which some grew along
  the ground and others upon trees, such a word as <i>tree-apple</i> would
  be required in order to be opposed to <i>earth-apple</i>, or
  <i>ground-apple</i>, or some word of the kind.</p>

  <p>In the compound words <i>tree-apple</i> and <i>apple-tree</i>, we have
  the same elements differently arranged. However, as the word
  <i>tree-apple</i> is not current in the language, the class of compounds
  indicated by it may seem to be merely imaginary. Nothing is farther from
  being the case. A <i>tree-rose</i> is a <i>rose</i> of a particular sort.
  The generality of <i>roses</i> being on <i>shrubs</i>, this grows on a
  <i>tree</i>. Its peculiarity consists in this fact, and this particular
  character is expressed by the word <i>tree</i> prefixed. A
  <i>rose-tree</i> is a <i>tree</i> of a particular sort, distinguished
  from <i>apple-trees</i>, and <i>trees</i> in general (in other words,
  particularised or defined), by the word <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `tree'."><i>rose</i></span> prefixed.</p>

  <p>A <i>ground-nut</i> is a <i>nut</i> particularised by growing in the
  ground. A <i>nut-ground</i> is a <i>ground</i> particularised by
  producing nuts.</p>

  <p>A <i>finger-ring</i>, as distinguished from an <i>ear-ring</i>, and
  from <i>rings</i> in general (and so particularised), is a <i>ring</i>
  for the <i>finger</i>. A <i>ring-finger</i>, as distinguished from
  <i>fore-fingers</i>, and from <i>fingers</i> in general (and so
  particularised), is a <i>finger</i> whereon <i>rings</i> are worn.</p>

  <p><a name="sect355">§ 355</a>. At times this rule seems to be violated.
  The words <i>spit-fire</i> and <i>dare-devil</i> seem exceptions to it.
  At the first glance it seems, in the case of a <i>spit-fire</i>, that
  what he (or she) <i>spits</i> is <i>fire</i>; and that, in the case of a
  <i>dare-devil</i>, what he (or she) <i>dares</i> is the <i>devil</i>. In
  this case the initial words <i>spit</i> and <i>dare</i> are
  particularised by the final ones <i>fire</i> and <i>devil</i>. The true
  idea, however, confirms the original rule. A <i>spit-fire</i> <!-- Page
  260 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page260"></a>[260]</span>voids his
  fire by spitting. A <i>dare-devil</i>, in meeting the fiend, would not
  shrink from him, but would defy him. A <i>spit-fire</i> is not one who
  spits fire, but one whose fire is <i>spit</i>. A <i>dare-devil</i> is not
  one who dares even the devil, but one by whom the devil is even
  dared.</p>

  <p><a name="sect356">§ 356</a>. Of the two elements of a compound word,
  which is the most important? In one sense the latter, in another sense
  the former. The latter word is the most <i>essential</i>; since the
  general idea of <i>trees</i> must exist before it can be defined or
  particularised; so becoming the idea which we have in <i>apple-tree</i>,
  <i>rose-tree</i>, &amp;c. The former word, however, is the most
  <i>influential</i>. It is by this that the original idea is qualified.
  The latter word is the staple original element: the former is the
  superadded influencing element. Compared with each other, the former
  element is active, the latter passive. Etymologically speaking, the
  former element, in English compounds, is the most important.</p>

  <p><a name="sect357">§ 357</a>. Most numerous are the observations that
  bear upon the detail of the composition of words; <i>e.g.</i>, how nouns
  combine with nouns, as in <i>sun-beam</i>; nouns with verbs, as in
  <i>dare-devil</i>, &amp;c. It is thought however, sufficient in the
  present work to be content with, 1. defining the meaning of the term
  composition; 2. explaining the nature of some obscure compounds.</p>

  <p>Composition is the joining together, <i>in language</i>, of <i>two
  different words</i>, and <i>treating the combination as a single
  term</i>. Observe the words in italics.</p>

  <p><i>In language.</i>&mdash;A great number of our compounds, like the
  word <i>merry-making</i>, are divided by the sign -, or the hyphen. It is
  very plain that if all words <i>spelt</i> <!-- Page 261 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page261"></a>[261]</span>with a hyphen were to
  be considered as compounds, the formation of them would be not a matter
  of speech, or language, but one of writing or spelling. This
  distinguishes compounds in language from mere printers' compounds.</p>

  <p><i>Two.</i>&mdash;For this, see § <a href="#sect369">369</a>.</p>

  <p><i>Different.</i>&mdash;In Old High German we find the form
  <i>sëlp-sëlpo</i>. Here there is the junction of two words, but not the
  junction of two <i>different</i> ones. This distinguishes composition
  from gemination.</p>

  <p><i>Words.</i>&mdash;In <i>father-s</i>, <i>clear-er</i>,
  <i>four-th</i>, &amp;c., there is the addition of a letter or a syllable,
  and it may be even of the part of a word. There is no addition, however,
  of a whole word. This distinguishes composition from derivation.</p>

  <p><i>Treating the combination as a single term.</i>&mdash;In determining
  between derived words and compound words, there is an occasional
  perplexity; the perplexity, however, is far greater in determining
  between a <i>compound word</i> and <i>two words</i>. In the eyes of one
  grammarian the term <i>mountain height</i> may be as truly a compound
  word as <i>sun-beam</i>. In the eyes of another grammarian it may be no
  compound word, but two words, just as <i>Alpine height</i> is two words;
  <i>mountain</i> being dealt with as an adjective. It is in the
  determination of this that the accent plays an important part.</p>

  <p><a name="sect358">§ 358</a>. As a preliminary to a somewhat subtle
  distinction, the attention of the reader is drawn to the following line,
  slightly altered, from Churchill:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Then rést, my friénd, <i>and spáre</i> thy précious bréath."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>On each of the syllables <i>rést</i>, <i>friénd</i>, <i>spáre</i>,
  <i>préc-</i>, <i>bréath</i>, there is an accent. Each of these syllables
  <!-- Page 262 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page262"></a>[262]</span>must be compared with the one that
  precedes it; <i>rest</i> with <i>then</i>, <i>friend</i> with <i>my</i>,
  and so on throughout the line. Compared with the word <i>and</i>, the
  word <i>spare</i> is not only accented, but the accent is conspicuous and
  prominent. There is so little on <i>and</i>, so much on <i>spare</i>,
  that the disparity of accent is very manifest.</p>

  <p>Now, if in the place of <i>and</i>, there were some other word, a word
  not so much accented as <i>spare</i>, but still more accented than
  <i>and</i>, this disparity would be diminished, and the accents of the
  two words might be said to be at <i>par</i>, or nearly so. As said
  before, the line was slightly altered from Churchill, the real reading
  being</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Then rést, my friénd, <i>spare, spare</i> thy précious bréath."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the true reading we actually find what had previously only been
  supposed. In the words <i>spare, spare</i>, the accents are nearly at
  <i>par</i>. Such the difference between accent at par and disparity of
  accent.</p>

  <p>Good illustrations of the parity and disparity of accent may be drawn
  from certain names of places. Let there be such a sentence as the
  following: <i>the lime house near the bridge north of the new port</i>.
  Compare the parity of accent on the pairs of words <i>lime</i> and
  <i>house</i>, <i>bridge</i> and <i>north</i>, <i>new</i> and <i>port</i>,
  with the disparity of accent in the compound words <i>Límehouse</i>,
  <i>Brídgenorth</i>, and <i>Néwport</i>. The separate words <i>beef
  steak</i>, where the accent is nearly at <i>par</i>, compared with the
  compound word <i>sweépstakes</i>, where there is a great disparity of
  accent, are further illustrations of the same difference.</p>

  <p>The difference between a compound word and a pair of words is further
  illustrated by comparing such terms as the following:&mdash;<i>bláck
  bírd</i>, meaning a <i>bird that <!-- Page 263 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page263"></a>[263]</span>is black</i>, with
  <i>bláckbird</i> = the Latin <i>merula</i>; <i>blúe béll</i>, meaning a
  <i>bell that is blue</i>, with <i>blúebell</i>, the flower. Expressions
  like a <i>shárp edgéd instrument</i>, meaning <i>an instrument that is
  sharp and has edges</i>, as opposed to <i>a shárp-edged instrument</i>,
  meaning <i>an instrument with sharp edges</i>, further exemplify this
  difference.</p>

  <p>Subject to a few exceptions, it may be laid down, that, in the English
  language, <i>there is no composition unless there is either a change of
  form or a change of accent</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect359">§ 359</a>. The reader is now informed, that unless
  he has taken an exception to either a statement or an inference, he has
  either seen beyond what has been already laid down by the author, or else
  has read him with insufficient attention. This may be shown by drawing a
  distinction between a compound form and a compound idea.</p>

  <p>In the words <i>a red house</i>, each word preserves its natural and
  original meaning, and the statement suggested by the term is <i>that a
  house is red</i>. By a parity of reasoning <i>a mad house</i> should mean
  a <i>house that is mad</i>; and provided that each word retain its
  <i>natural meaning</i> and its <i>natural accent</i>, such is the fact.
  Let a <i>house</i> mean, as it often does, a <i>family</i>. Then the
  phrase, <i>a mad house</i>, means that the <i>house</i>, <i>or
  family</i>, <i>is mad</i>, just as a <i>red house</i> means that the
  <i>house is red</i>. Such, however, is not the current meaning of the
  word. Every one knows that <i>a mad house</i> means <i>a house for mad
  men</i>; in which case it is treated as a compound word, and has a marked
  accent on the first syllable, just as <i>Límehouse</i> has. Now, compared
  with the word <i>red house</i>, meaning a house of a <i>red colour</i>,
  and compared with the words <i>mad house</i>, meaning a <i>deranged
  family</i>, the word <!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page264"></a>[264]</span><i>mádhouse</i>, in its common sense,
  expressed a compound idea; as opposed to two ideas, or a double idea. The
  word <i>beef steak</i> is evidently a compound idea; but as there is no
  disparity of accent, it is not a compound word. Its sense is compound.
  Its form is not compound but double. This indicates the objection
  anticipated, which is this: <i>viz.</i>, that a definition, which would
  exclude such a word as <i>beef steak</i> from the list of compounds, is,
  for that very reason, exceptionable. I answer to this, that the term in
  question is a compound idea, and not a compound form; in other words,
  that it is a compound in logic, but not a compound in etymology. Now
  etymology, taking cognisance of forms only, has nothing to do with ideas,
  except so far as they influence forms.</p>

  <p>Such is the commentary upon the words, <i>treating the combination as
  a single term</i>; in other words, such the difference between a compound
  word and two words. The rule, being repeated, stands (subject to
  exceptions indicated above) thus:&mdash;<i>there is no true composition
  without either a change of form or a change of accent</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect360">§ 360</a>. As I wish to be clear upon this point, I
  shall illustrate the statement by its application.</p>

  <p>The term <i>trée-rose</i> is often pronounced <i>trée róse</i>; that
  is, with the accent at <i>par</i>. It is compound in the one case; it is
  a pair of words in the other.</p>

  <p>The terms <i>mountain ash</i> and <i>mountain height</i> are generally
  (perhaps always) pronounced with an equal accent on the syllables
  <i>mount-</i> and <i>ash</i>, <i>mount-</i> and <i>height</i>,
  respectively. In this case the word <i>mountain</i> must be dealt with as
  an adjective, and the words considered as two. The word <i>moúntain
  wave</i> is often pronounced with a visible diminution of accent on the
  <!-- Page 265 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page265"></a>[265]</span>last syllable. In this case there is a
  disparity of accent, and the word is compound.</p>

  <p><a name="sect361">§ 361</a>. The following quotation indicates a
  further cause of perplexity in determining between compound words and two
  words:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i12">1.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>A wet sheet and a blowing gale,</p>
      <p class="i2">A breeze that follows fast;</p>
      <p>That fills the white and swelling sail,</p>

    </div>

    <div class="stanza">

      <p class="i2">Her home is on the deep.&mdash;<span class="sc">Thomas Campbell.</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>To speak first of the term <i>gallant mast</i>. If <i>gallant</i> mean
  <i>brave</i>, there are <i>two words</i>. If the words be two, there is a
  stronger accent on <i>mast</i>. If the accent on <i>mast</i> be stronger,
  the rhyme with <i>fast</i> is more complete; in other words, the metre
  favours the notion of the words being considered as <i>two</i>.
  <i>Gallant-mast</i>, however, is a compound word, with an especial
  nautical meaning. In this case the accent is stronger on <i>gal-</i> and
  weaker on <i>-mast</i>. This, however, is not the state of things that
  the metre favours. The same applies to <i>mountain wave</i>. The same
  person who in prose would throw a stronger accent on <i>mount-</i> and a
  weaker one on <i>wave</i> (so dealing with the word as a compound),
  might, in poetry, the words <i>two</i>, by giving to the last syllable a
  parity of accent.</p>

  <p>The following quotation from Ben Jonson may be <!-- Page 266 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page266"></a>[266]</span>read in two ways; and
  the accent may vary with the reading:</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><a name="sect362">§ 362</a>. <i>On certain words wherein the fact of
  their being compound is obscured.</i>&mdash;Composition is the addition
  of a word to a word, derivation is the addition of certain letters or
  syllables to a word. In a compound form each element has a separate and
  independent existence; in a derived form, only one of the elements has
  such. Now it is very possible that in an older stage of a language two
  words may exist, may be put together, and may so form a compound, each
  word having, then, a separate and independent existence. In a later stage
  of language, however, only one of these words may have a separate and
  independent existence, the other having become obsolete. In this case a
  compound word would take the appearance of a derived one, since but one
  of its elements could be exhibited as a separate and independent word.
  Such is the case with, amongst others, the word <i>bishop-ric</i>. In the
  present language the word <i>ric</i> has no separate and independent
  existence. For all this, the word is a true compound, since, in
  Anglo-Saxon, we have the noun <i>ríce</i> as a separate, independent
  word, signifying <i>kingdom</i> or <i>domain</i>.</p>

  <p>Again, without becoming obsolete, a word may alter its form. This is
  the case with most of our adjectives <!-- Page 267 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page267"></a>[267]</span>in <i>-ly</i>. At
  present they appear derivative; their termination <i>-ly</i> having no
  separate and independent existence. The older language, however, shows
  that they are compounds; since <i>-ly</i> is nothing else than
  <i>-lic</i>, Anglo-Saxon; <i>-lih</i>, Old High German; <i>-leiks</i>,
  M&oelig;so-Gothic; = <i>like</i>, or <i>similis</i>, and equally with it
  an independent separate word.</p>

  <p><a name="sect363">§ 363</a>. "Subject to a few exceptions, it may be
  laid down, that <i>there is no true composition unless there is either a
  change of form or a change of accent</i>."&mdash;Such is the statement
  made in § <a href="#sect358">358</a>. The first class of exceptions
  consists of those words where the natural tendency to disparity of accent
  is traversed by some rule of euphony. For example, let two words be put
  together, which at their point of contact form a combination of sounds
  foreign to our habits of pronunciation. The rarity of the combination
  will cause an effort in utterance. The effort in utterance will cause an
  accent to be laid on the latter half of the compound. This will equalize
  the accent, and abolish the disparity. The word <i>monkshood</i>, the
  name of a flower (<i>aconitum napellus</i>), where, to my ear at least,
  there is quite as much accent on the <i>-hood</i> as on the
  <i>monks-</i>, may serve in the way of illustration. <i>Monks</i> is one
  word, <i>hood</i> another. When joined together, the <i>h-</i> of the
  <i>-hood</i> is put in immediate apposition with the <i>s</i> of the
  <i>monks-</i>. Hence the combination <i>monkshood</i>. At the letters
  <i>s</i> and <i>h</i> is the point of contact. Now the sound of <i>s</i>
  followed immediately by the sound of <i>h</i> is a true aspirate. But
  true aspirates are rare in the English language. Being of rare
  occurrence, the pronunciation of them is a matter of attention and
  effort; and this attention and effort create an accent which otherwise
  would be absent. <!-- Page 268 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page268"></a>[268]</span>Hence words like <i>mónks-hóod</i>,
  <i>well-héad</i>, and some others.</p>

  <p>Real reduplications of consonants, as in <i>hóp-póle</i>, may have the
  same parity of accent with the true aspirates: and for the same reasons.
  They are rare combinations that require effort and attention.</p>

  <p><a name="sect364">§ 364</a>. The second class of exceptions contains
  those words wherein between the first element and the second there is so
  great a disparity, either in the length of the vowel, or the length of
  the syllable <i>en masse</i>, as to counteract the natural tendency of
  the first element to become accented. One of the few specimens of this
  class (which after all may consist of double words) is the term
  <i>upstánding</i>. Here it should be remembered, that words like
  <i>hapházard</i>, <i>foolhárdy</i>, <i>uphólder</i>, and <i>withhóld</i>
  come under the first class of the exceptions.</p>

  <p><a name="sect365">§ 365</a>. The third class of exceptions contains
  words like <i>perchánce</i> and <i>perháps</i>. In all respects but one
  these are double words, just as <i>by chance</i> is a double word.
  <i>Per</i>, however, differs from <i>by</i> in having no separate
  existence. This sort of words we owe to the multiplicity of elements
  (classical and Gothic) in the English language.</p>

  <p><a name="sect366">§ 366</a>. <i>Peacock</i>, <i>peahen</i>.&mdash;If
  these words be rendered masculine or feminine by the addition of the
  elements <i>-cock</i> and <i>-hen</i>, the statements made in the
  beginning of the present chapter are invalidated. Since, if the word
  <i>pea-</i> be particularized, qualified, or defined by the words
  <i>-cock</i> and <i>-hen</i>, the <i>second</i> term defines or
  particularises the <i>first</i>, which is contrary to the rule of § <a
  href="#sect356">356</a>. The truth, however, is, that the words
  <i>-cock</i> and <i>-hen</i> are defined by the prefix <i>pea-</i>.
  Preparatory to the exhibition of this, let us remember that the word
  <i>pea</i> (although <!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page269"></a>[269]</span>now found in composition only) is a true
  and independent substantive, the name of a species of fowl, like
  <i>pheasant</i>, <i>partridge</i>, or any other appellation. It is the
  Latin <i>pavo</i>, German <i>pfau</i>. Now if the word <i>peacock</i>
  mean a <i>pea</i> (<i>pfau</i> or <i>pavo</i>) that is a male, then do
  <i>wood-cock</i>, <i>black-cock</i>, and <i>bantam-cock</i>, mean
  <i>woods</i>, <i>blacks</i>, and <i>bantams</i> that are male. Or if the
  word <i>peahen</i> mean a <i>pea</i> (<i>pfau</i> or <i>pavo</i>) that is
  female, then do <i>moorhen</i> and <i>guineahen</i> mean <i>moors</i> and
  <i>guineas</i> that are female. Again, if a <i>peahen</i> mean a
  <i>pea</i> (<i>pfau</i> or <i>pavo</i>) that is female, then does the
  compound <i>pheasant-hen</i> mean the same as <i>hen-pheasant</i>; which
  is not the case. The fact is that <i>peacock</i> means a <i>cock that is
  a pea</i> (<i>pfau</i> or <i>pavo</i>); <i>peahen</i> means a <i>hen that
  is a pea</i> (<i>pfau</i> or <i>pavo</i>); and, finally, <i>peafowl</i>
  means a <i>fowl that is a pea</i> (<i>pfau</i> or <i>pavo</i>). In the
  same way <i>moorfowl</i> means, not a <i>moor that is connected with a
  fowl</i>, but a <i>fowl that is connected with a moor</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect367">§ 367</a>. It must be clear that in every compound
  word there are, at least, two parts; <i>i.e.</i>, the whole or part of
  the original, and the whole or part of the superadded word. In the most
  perfect forms of inflection, however, there is a <i>third</i> element,
  <i>viz.</i>, a vowel, consonant, or syllable that joins the first word
  with the second.</p>

  <p>In the older forms of all the Gothic languages the presence of this
  third element was the rule rather than the exception. In the present
  English it exists in but few words.</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> The <i>-a-</i> in <i>black-a-moor</i> is possibly such a
  connecting element.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> The <i>-in-</i> in <i>night-in-gale</i> is most probably
  such a connecting element. Compare the German form <!-- Page 270 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page270"></a>[270]</span><i>nacht-i-gale</i>,
  and remember the tendency of vowels to take the sound of <i>-ng</i>
  before <i>g</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect368">§ 368</a>. <i>Improper compounds.</i>&mdash;The
  <i>-s-</i> in words like <i>Thur-s-day</i>, <i>hunt-s-man</i>, may be one
  of two things.</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> It may be the sign of the genitive case, so that
  <i>Thursday</i> = <i>Thoris dies</i>. In this case the word is an
  <i>improper compound</i>, since it is like the word <i>pater-familias</i>
  in Latin, in a common state of syntactical construction.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> It may be a connecting sound, like the <i>-i-</i> in
  <i>nacht-i-gale</i>. Reasons for this view occur in the following
  fact:&mdash;</p>

  <p>In the modern German languages the genitive case of feminine nouns
  ends otherwise than in <i>-s</i>. Nevertheless, the sound of <i>-s-</i>
  occurs in composition equally, whether the noun it follows be masculine
  or feminine. This fact, as far as it goes, makes it convenient to
  consider the sound in question as a connective rather than a case.
  Probably, it is neither one nor the other exactly, but the effect of a
  false analogy.</p>

  <p><a name="sect369">§ 369</a>. <i>Decomposites.</i>&mdash;"Composition
  is the joining together of <i>two</i> words."&mdash;See § <a
  href="#sect357">357</a>.</p>

  <p>Words like <i>mid-ship-man</i>, <i>gentle-man-like</i>, &amp;c., where
  the number of verbal elements seems to amount to <i>three</i>, are no
  exception to this rule; since <i>compound radicals</i> like
  <i>midship</i> and <i>gentleman</i>, are, for the purposes of
  composition, single words. Compounds wherein one element is compound are
  called <i>decomposites</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect370">§ 370</a>. There are a number of words which are
  never found by themselves; or, if so found, have never the same sense
  that they have in <i>combination</i>. Mark the word <i>combination</i>.
  The terms in question are points of <i>combination</i>, not of
  composition: since they form not the <!-- Page 271 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page271"></a>[271]</span>parts of words, but the
  parts of phrases. Such are the expressions <i>time and
  tide</i>&mdash;<i>might and main</i>&mdash;<i>rede me my
  riddle</i>&mdash;<i>pay your shot</i>&mdash;<i>rhyme and reason</i>,
  &amp;c. These words are evidently of the same class, though not of the
  same species with <i>bishopric</i>, <i>colewort</i>, <i>spillikin</i>,
  <i>gossip</i>, <i>mainswearer</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>These last-mentioned terms give us obsolete words preserved in
  composition. The former give us obsolete words preserved in
  combination.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON DERIVATION AND INFLECTION.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect371">§ 371</a>. <i>Derivation</i>, like <i>etymology</i>,
  is a word used in a wide and in a limited sense. In the wide sense of the
  term, every word, except it be in the simple form of a root, is a derived
  word. In this sense the cases, numbers, and genders of nouns, the
  persons, moods, and tenses of verbs, the ordinal numbers, the
  diminutives, and even the compound words, are alike matters of
  derivation. In the wide sense of the term the word <i>fathers</i>, from
  <i>father</i>, is equally in a state of derivation with the word
  <i>strength</i> from <i>strong</i>.</p>

  <p>In the use of the word, even in its limited sense, there is
  considerable laxity and uncertainty.</p>

  <p><i>Gender</i>, <i>number</i>, <i>case</i>.&mdash;These have been
  called the <i>accidents</i> of the noun, and these it has been agreed to
  separate from derivation in its stricter sense, or from derivation
  properly so called, and to class together under the name of declension.
  Nouns are <i>declined</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Person</i>, <i>number</i>, <i>tense</i>, <i>voice</i>.&mdash;These
  have been called the <i>accidents</i> of a verb, and these it has been
  agreed to separate from derivation properly so called, and to class
  together under the name of conjugation. Verbs are <i>conjugated</i>.</p>

  <p>Conjugation and declension constitute inflection. Nouns and verbs,
  speaking generally, are inflected. <!-- Page 273 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page273"></a>[273]</span></p>

  <p>Inflection, a part of derivation in its wider sense, is separated from
  derivation properly so called, or from derivation in its limited
  sense.</p>

  <p>The degrees of comparison, or certain derived forms of adjectives; the
  ordinals, or certain derived forms of the numerals; the diminutives,
  &amp;c., or certain derived forms of the substantive, have been separated
  from derivation properly so called, and considered as parts of
  inflection. I am not certain, however, that for so doing there is any
  better reason than mere convenience.</p>

  <p>Derivation proper, the subject of the present chapter, comprises all
  the changes that words undergo, which are not referable to some of the
  preceding heads. As such, it is, in its details, a wider field than even
  composition. The details, however, are not entered into.</p>

  <p><a name="sect372">§ 372</a>. Derivation proper may be divided
  according to a variety of principles. Amongst others&mdash;</p>

  <p>I. <i>According to the evidence.</i>&mdash;In the evidence that a word
  is not simple, but derived, there are at least two degrees.</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> That the word <i>strength</i> is a derived word I collect to
  a certainty from the word <i>strong</i>, an independent form, which I can
  separate from it. Of the nature of the word <i>strength</i> there is the
  clearest evidence, or evidence of the first degree.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> <i>Fowl</i>, <i>hail</i>, <i>nail</i>, <i>sail</i>,
  <i>tail</i>, <i>soul</i>; in Anglo-Saxon, <i>fugel</i>, <i>hægel</i>,
  <i>nægel</i>, <i>segel</i>, <i>tægel</i>, <i>sawel</i>.&mdash;These words
  are by the best grammarians considered as derivatives. Now, with these
  words I cannot do what was done with the word <i>strength</i>, I cannot
  take from them the part which I look upon as the derivational addition,
  and after that leave an independent word. <i>Strength</i> <i>-th</i> is a
  true word; <i>fowl</i> or <i>fugel</i> <i>-l</i> is no true word. If I
  believe <!-- Page 274 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page274"></a>[274]</span>these latter words to be derivations at
  all, I do it because I find in words like <i>harelle</i>, &amp;c., the
  <i>-l</i> as a derivational addition. Yet, as the fact of a word being
  sometimes used as a derivational addition does not preclude it from being
  at other times a part of the root, the evidence that the words in
  question are not simple, but derived, is not cogent. In other words, it
  is evidence of the second degree.</p>

  <p>II. <i>According to the effect.</i>&mdash;The syllable <i>-en</i> in
  the word <i>whiten</i> changes the noun <i>white</i> into a verb. This is
  its effect. We may so classify derivational forms as to arrange
  combinations like <i>-en</i> (whose effect is to give the idea of the
  verb) in one order; whilst combinations like <i>-th</i> (whose effect is,
  as in the word <i>strength</i>, to give the idea of abstraction) form
  another order.</p>

  <p>III. <i>According to the form.</i>&mdash;Sometimes the derivational
  element is a vowel (as the <i>-ie</i> in <i>doggie</i>), sometimes a
  consonant (as the <i>-th</i> in <i>strength</i>), sometimes a vowel and
  consonant combined; in other words a syllable (as the <i>-en</i>, in
  <i>whiten</i>), sometimes a change of vowel without any addition (as the
  <i>-i</i> in <i>tip</i>, compared with <i>top</i>), sometimes a change of
  consonant without any addition (as the <i>z</i> in <i>prize</i>, compared
  with <i>price</i>). Sometimes it is a change of accent, like a
  <i>súrvey</i>, compared with <i>to survéy</i>. To classify derivations in
  this manner, is to classify them according to their form.</p>

  <p>IV. <i>According to the historical origin of the derivational
  elements.</i></p>

  <p>V. <i>According to the number of the derivational
  elements.</i>&mdash;In <i>fisher</i>, as compared with <i>fish</i>, there
  is but one derivational affix. In <i>fishery</i>, as compared with
  <i>fish</i>, the number of derivational elements is two. <!-- Page 275
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"></a>[275]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect373">§ 373</a>. In words like <i>bishopric</i>, and many
  others mentioned in the last Chapter, we had compound words under the
  appearance of derived ones; in words like <i>upmost</i>, and many others,
  we have derivation under the appearance of composition.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ADVERBS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect374">§ 374</a>. <i>Adverbs.</i>&mdash;The adverbs are
  capable of being classified after a variety of principles.</p>

  <p>Firstly, they may be divided according to their meaning. In this case
  we speak of the adverbs of <i>time</i>, <i>place</i>, <i>number</i>,
  <i>manner</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect375">§ 375</a>. <i>Well</i>, <i>better</i>, <i>ill</i>,
  <i>worse</i>.&mdash;Here we have a class of adverbs expressive of degree,
  or intensity. Adverbs of this kind are capable of taking an inflection,
  <i>viz.</i>, that of the comparative and superlative degrees.</p>

  <p><i>Now</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>here</i>, <i>there</i>.&mdash;In the idea
  expressed by these words there are no degrees of intensity. Adverbs of
  this kind are incapable of taking any inflection.</p>

  <p>Adverbs differ from nouns and verbs in being susceptible of one sort
  of inflection only, <i>viz.</i>, that of degree.</p>

  <p><a name="sect376">§ 376</a>. Secondly, adverbs may be divided
  according to their form and origin.</p>

  <p><i>Better</i>, <i>worse</i>.&mdash;Here the words are sometimes
  adverbs; sometimes adjectives.&mdash;<i>This book is better than
  that</i>&mdash;here <i>better</i> agrees with <i>book</i>, and is,
  therefore, adjectival. <i>This looks better than that</i>&mdash;here
  <i>better</i> qualifies <i>looks</i>, and is therefore adverbial. Again;
  <i>to do a thing with violence</i> is equivalent <i>to do a thing
  violently</i>. This shows how adverbs may arise out of cases. In words
  like the English <i>better</i>, the Latin <i>vi</i> = <i>violenter</i>,
  the Greek <span title="kalon" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&#x1F78;&nu;</span> = <span title="kalôs" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&#x1FF6;&sigmaf;</span>, we have adjectives in
  their <!-- Page 277 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page277"></a>[277]</span>degrees, and substantives in their cases,
  with adverbial powers. In other words, nouns are deflected from their
  natural sense to an adverbial one. Adverbs of this kind are adverbs of
  <i>deflection</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Brightly</i>, <i>bravely</i>.&mdash;Here an adjective is rendered
  adverbial by the addition of the derivative syllable <i>-ly</i>. Adverbs
  like <i>brightly</i>, &amp;c., may be called adverbs of
  <i>derivation</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Now</i>.&mdash;This word has not satisfactorily been shown to have
  originated as any other part of speech but as an adverb. Words of this
  sort are adverbs <i>absolute</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect377">§ 377</a>. <i>When</i>, <i>now</i>, <i>well</i>,
  <i>worse</i>, <i>better</i>&mdash;here the adverbial expression consists
  in a single word, and is <i>simple</i>. <i>To-day</i>, <i>yesterday</i>,
  <i>not at all</i>, <i>somewhat</i>&mdash;here the adverbial expression
  consists of a compound word, or a phrase. This indicates the division of
  adverbs into <i>simple</i> and <i>complex</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect378">§ 378</a>. Adverbs of deflection may originally have
  been&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> <i>Substantive</i>; as <i>needs</i> in such expressions as
  <i>I needs must go</i>.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> <i>Adjectives</i>; as the <i>sun shines bright</i>.</p>

  <p><i>c.</i> <i>Prepositions</i>; as <i>I go in</i>, <i>we go out</i>;
  though, it should be added, that in this case we may as reasonably derive
  the preposition from the adverb as the adverb from the preposition.</p>

  <p><a name="sect379">§ 379</a>. Adjectives of deflection derived from
  substantives may originally have been&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> <i>Substantives in the </i>genitive<i> case</i>; as
  <i>needs</i>.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> <i>Substantives in the </i>dative<i> case</i>; as
  <i>whil-om</i>, an antiquated word meaning <i>at times</i>, and often
  improperly spelt <i>whilome</i>. In such an expression as <i>wait a
  while</i>, the word still exists; and <i>while</i> = <i>time</i>, or
  rather <i>pause</i>; since, in Danish, <i>hvile</i> = <i>rest</i>. <!--
  Page 278 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page278"></a>[278]</span></p>

  <p><i>El-se</i> (for <i>ell-es</i>); <i>unawar-es</i>; <i>eftsoon-s</i>
  are <i>adjectives</i> in the genitive case. <i>By rights</i> is a word of
  the same sort; the <i>-s</i> being the sign of the genitive singular like
  the <i>-s</i> in <i>father's</i>, and not of the accusative plural like
  the <i>-s</i> in <i>fathers</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Once</i> (<i>on-es</i>); <i>twice</i> (<i>twi-es</i>);
  <i>thrice</i> (<i>thri-es</i>) are <i>numerals</i> in the genitive
  case.</p>

  <p><a name="sect380">§ 380</a>. <i>Darkling</i>.&mdash;This is no
  participle of a verb <i>darkle</i>, but an adverb of derivation, like
  <i>unwaringûn</i> = <i>unawares</i>, Old High German; <i>stillinge</i> =
  <i>secretly</i>, Middle High German; <i>blindlings</i> = <i>blindly</i>,
  New High German; <i>darnungo</i> = <i>secretly</i>, Old Saxon;
  <i>nichtinge</i> = <i>by night</i>, Middle Dutch; <i>blindeling</i> =
  <i>blindly</i>, New Dutch; <i>bæclinga</i> = <i>backwards</i>,
  <i>handlunga</i> = <i>hand to hand</i>, Anglo-Saxon; and, finally,
  <i>blindlins</i>, <i>backlins</i>, <i>darklins</i>, <i>middlins</i>,
  <i>scantlins</i>, <i>stridelins</i>, <i>stowlins</i>, in Lowland
  Scotch.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON CERTAIN ADVERBS OF PLACE.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect381">§ 381</a>. It is a common practice for languages to
  express by different modifications of the same root the three following
  ideas:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The idea of rest <i>in</i> a place.</p>

  <p>2. The idea of motion <i>towards</i> a place.</p>

  <p>3. The idea of motion <i>from</i> a place.</p>

  <p>This habit gives us three correlative adverbs&mdash;one of
  <i>position</i>, and two of <i>direction</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect382">§ 382</a>. It is also a common practice of language
  to depart from the original expression of each particular idea, and to
  interchange the signs by which they are expressed; so that a word
  originally expressive of simple position or <i>rest in a place</i> may be
  used instead of the word expressive of direction, <i>or motion between
  two places</i>. Hence we say, <i>come here</i>, when <i>come hither</i>
  would be the more correct expression.</p>

  <p><a name="sect383">§ 383</a>. The full amount of change in this <span

  <i>hen-ce</i>, <i>when-ce</i>, <i>then-ce</i>, has yet to be
  satisfactorily explained. The Old English is <i>whenn-es</i>,
  <i>thenn-es</i>. As far, therefore, as the spelling is concerned, they

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE GRAMMATICAL POSITION OF THE WORDS MINE AND THINE.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect394">§ 394</a>. The inflection of pronouns has its
  natural peculiarities in language. It has also its natural difficulties
  in philology. These occur not in one language in particular, but in all
  generally.</p>

  <p>The most common peculiarity in the grammar of pronouns is the fact of
  what may be called their <i>convertibility</i>. Of this
  <i>convertibility</i> the following statements serve as
  illustration:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. <i>Of case.</i>&mdash;In our own language the words <i>my</i> and
  <i>thy</i> although at present possessives, were previously datives, and,
  earlier still, accusatives. Again, the accusative <i>you</i> replaces the
  nominative <i>ye</i>, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Of number.</i>&mdash;The words <i>thou</i> and <i>thee</i> are,
  except in the mouths of Quakers, obsolete. The plural forms, <i>ye</i>
  and <i>you</i>, have replaced them.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Of person.</i>&mdash;The Greek language gives us examples of
  this in the promiscuous use of <span title="nin" class="grk"
  >&nu;&iota;&nu;</span>, <span title="min" class="grk"
  >&mu;&iota;&nu;</span>, <span title="sphe" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&phi;&epsilon;</span>, and <span title="heautou" class="grk"
  >&#x1F11;&alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&omicron;&#x1FE6;</span>; whilst
  <i>sich</i> and <i>sik</i> are used with a similar latitude in the Middle
  High German and Scandinavian.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Of class.</i>&mdash;The demonstrative pronouns become&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>a.</i> Personal pronouns.</p>
      <p><i>b.</i> Relative pronouns.</p>
      <p><i>c.</i> Articles.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 285 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page285"></a>[285]</span></p>

  <p>The reflective pronoun often becomes reciprocal.</p>

  <p><a name="sect395">§ 395</a>. These statements are made for the sake of
  illustrating, not of exhausting, the subject. It follows, however, as an
  inference from them, that the classification of pronouns is complicated.
  Even if we knew the original power and derivation of every form of every
  pronoun in a language, it would be far from an easy matter to determine
  therefrom the paradigm that they should take in grammar. To place a word
  according to its power in a late stage of language might confuse the
  study of an early stage. To say that because a word was once in a given
  class, it should always be so, would be to deny that in the present
  English <i>they</i>, <i>these</i>, and <i>she</i> are personal pronouns
  at all.</p>

  <p>The two tests, then, of the grammatical place of a pronoun, its
  <i>present power</i> and its <i>original power</i>, are often
  conflicting.</p>

  <p><a name="sect396">§ 396</a>. In the English language the point of most
  importance in this department of grammar is the place of forms like
  <i>mine</i> and <i>thine</i>; in other words, of the forms in
  <i>-n</i>.</p>

  <p>Now, if we take up the common grammars of the English language <i>as
  it is</i>, we find, that, whilst <i>my</i> and <i>thy</i> are dealt with
  as genitive cases, <i>mine</i> and <i>thine</i> are considered
  adjectives. In the <i>Anglo-Saxon</i> grammars, however, <i>min</i> and
  <i>þin</i>, the older forms of <i>mine</i> and <i>thine</i>, are treated
  as genitives or possessives.</p>

  <p><a name="sect397">§ 397</a>. This gives us two views of the words
  <i>my</i> and <i>thy</i>.</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> They may be genitives or possessives, which were originally
  datives or accusatives; in which case they are deduced from the
  Anglo-Saxon <i>mec</i> and <span class="correction" title="Original reads `pec'."
  ><i>þec</i></span>.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> They may be the Anglo-Saxon <i>min</i> and <i>þin</i>,
  <i>minus</i> the final <i>-n</i>. <!-- Page 286 --><span

  <p>Each of these views has respectable supporters. The former is
  decidedly preferred by the present writer.</p>

  <p><a name="sect398">§ 398</a>. What, however, are <i>thine</i> and
  <i>mine</i>? Are they adjectives like <i>meus</i>, <i>tuus</i>, and
  <i>suus</i>, or cases like <i>mei</i>, <i>tui</i>, <i>sui</i>, in Latin,
  and <i>hi-s</i> in English?</p>

  <p>It is no answer to say that sometimes they are one and sometimes the
  other. They were not so originally. They did not begin with meaning two
  things at once; on the contrary, they were either possessive cases, of
  which the power became subsequently adjectival, or adjectives, of which
  the power became subsequently possessive.</p>

  <p><a name="sect399">§ 399</a>. In Anglo-Saxon and in Old Saxon there is
  but one form to express the Latin <i>mei</i> (or <i>tui</i>), on the one
  side, and <i>meus</i>, <i>mea</i>, <i>meum</i> (or <i>tuus</i>, &amp;c.),
  on the other. In several other Gothic tongues, however, there was the
  following difference of form:</p>

  <p>In these differences of form lie the best reasons for the assumption
  of a genitive case, as the origin of an adjectival form; and,
  undoubtedly, in those languages where both forms occur, it is convenient
  to consider one as a case and one as an adjective.</p>

  <p><a name="sect400">§ 400</a>. But this is not the present question. In
  <!-- Page 287 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page287"></a>[287]</span>Anglo-Saxon there is but one form,
  <i>min</i> and <i>þin</i> = <i>mei</i> and <i>meus</i>, <i>tui</i> and
  <i>tuus</i>, indifferently. Is this form an oblique case or an
  adjective?</p>

  <p>This involves two sorts of evidence.</p>

  <p><a name="sect401">§ 401</a>. <i>Etymological
  evidence.</i>&mdash;Assuming two <i>powers</i> for the words <i>min</i>
  and <i>þin</i>, one genitive, and one adjectival, which is the original
  one? Or, going beyond the Anglo-Saxon, assuming that of two <i>forms</i>
  like <i>meina</i> and <i>meins</i>, the one has been derived from the
  other, which is the primitive, radical, primary, or original one?</p>

  <p>Men, from whom it is generally unsafe to differ, consider that the
  adjectival form is the derived one; and, as far as forms like
  <i>mîner</i>, as opposed to <i>mîn</i>, are concerned, the evidence of
  the foregoing list is in their favour. But what is the case with the
  Middle Dutch? The genitive <i>mîns</i> is evidently the derivative of
  <i>mîn</i>.</p>

  <p>The reason why the forms like <i>mîner</i> seem derived is because
  they are longer and more complex than the others. Nevertheless, it is by
  no means an absolute rule in philology that the least compound form is
  the oldest. A word may be adapted to a secondary meaning by a change in
  its parts in the way of omission, as well as by a change in the way of
  addition.</p>

  <p><a name="sect402">§ 402</a>. As to the question whether it is most
  likely for an adjective to be derived from a case, or a case from an
  adjective, it may be said, that philology furnishes instances both ways.
  <i>Ours</i> is a case derived, in syntax at least, from an adjective.
  <i>Cujum</i> (as in <i>cujum pecus</i>) and <i>sestertium</i> are Latin
  instances of a nominative case being evolved from an oblique one.</p>

  <p><a name="sect403">§ 403</a>. <i>Syntactic evidence.</i>&mdash;If in
  Anglo-Saxon we found such expressions as <i>d&oelig;l min</i> = <i>pars
  mei</i>, <i>h&oelig;lf þin</i> <!-- Page 288 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page288"></a>[288]</span>= <i>dimidium tui</i>, we should have a
  reason, as far as it went, for believing in the existence of a true
  genitive. Such instances, however, have yet to be quoted.</p>

  <p><a name="sect404">§ 404</a>. Again&mdash;as <i>min</i> and <i>þin</i>
  are declined like adjectives, even as <i>meus</i> and <i>tuus</i> are so
  declined, we have means of ascertaining their nature from the form they
  take in certain constructions; thus, <i>mi</i>nra = <i>me</i>orum, and
  <i>min</i>re = <i>me</i>æ, are the genitive plural and the dative
  singular respectively. Thus, too, the Anglo-Saxon for <i>of thy eyes</i>
  should be <i>eagena þinra</i>, and the Anglo-Saxon for <i>to my
  widow</i>, should be <i>wuduwan minre</i>; just as in Latin, they would
  be <i>oculorum tuorum</i>, and <i>viduæ meæ.</i></p>

  <p>If, however, instead of this we find such expressions as <i>eagena
  þin</i>, or <i>wuduwan min</i>, we find evidence in favour of a genitive
  case; for then the construction is not one of concord, but one of
  government, and the words <i>þin</i> and <i>min</i> must be construed as
  the Latin forms <i>tui</i> and <i>mei</i> would be in <i>oculorum
  mei</i>, and <i>viduæ mei</i>; <i>viz.</i>: as genitive cases. Now,
  whether a sufficient proportion of such constructions exist or not, they
  have not yet been brought forward.</p>

  <p>Such instances, even if quoted, would not be conclusive.</p>

  <p><a name="sect405">§ 405</a>. Why would they not be conclusive? Because
  <i>even of the adjective there are uninflected forms</i>.</p>

  <p>As early as the M&oelig;so-Gothic stage of our language, we find
  rudiments of this omission of the inflection. The possessive pronouns in
  the <i>neuter singular</i> sometimes take the inflection, sometimes
  appear as crude forms, <i>nim thata badi theinata</i> = <span
  title="airon sou ton krabbaton" class="grk">&#x1F86;&rho;&#x1F79;&nu;
  &sigma;&omicron;&upsilon; &tau;&#x1F78;&nu;
  &kappa;&rho;&#x1F71;&beta;&beta;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&nu;</span> (Mark
  ii. 9), opposed to <i>nim thata badi thein</i>, two verses afterwards. So
  also with <i>mein</i> and <i>meinata</i>. It is remarkable that this
  omission should begin with <!-- Page 289 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page289"></a>[289]</span>forms so marked as those of the neuter
  (-<i>ata</i>). It has, perhaps, its origin in the adverbial character of
  that gender.</p>

  <p><i>Old High German.</i>&mdash;Here the nominatives, both masculine and
  feminine, lose the inflection, whilst the neuter retains it&mdash;<i>thin
  dohter</i>, <i>sîn quenâ</i>, <i>min dohter</i>, <i>sinaz lîb</i>. In a
  few cases, when the pronoun comes after, even the <i>oblique</i> cases
  drop the inflection.</p>

  <p><i>Middle High German.</i>&mdash;<i>Preceding</i> the noun, the
  nominative of all genders is destitute of inflection; <i>sîn lîb</i>,
  <i>mîn ere</i>, <i>dîn lîb</i>, &amp;c. <i>Following</i> the nouns, the
  oblique cases do the same; <i>ine herse sîn</i>. The influence of
  position should here be noticed. Undoubtedly a place <i>after</i> the
  substantive influences the omission of the inflection. This appears in
  its <i>maximum</i> in the Middle High German. In M&oelig;so-Gothic we
  have <i>mein leik</i> and <i>leik meinata</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect406">§ 406</a>. Now by assuming the extension of the
  Middle High German omission of the inflection to the Anglo-Saxon; and by
  supposing it to affect the words in question in <i>all</i> positions
  (<i>i.e.</i>, both before and after their nouns), we may explain the
  constructions in question, in case they occur. But, as already stated, no
  instances of them have been quoted.</p>

  <p>To suppose <i>two</i> adjectival forms, one inflected (<i>min</i>,
  <i>minre</i>, &amp;c.), and one uninflected, or common to all genders and
  both numbers (<i>min</i>), is to suppose no more than is the case with
  the uninflected <i>þe</i>, as compared with the inflected <i>þæt</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect407">§ 407</a>. Hence, the evidence required in order to
  make a single instance of <i>min</i> or <i>þin</i>, the <i>necessary</i>
  equivalents to <i>mei</i> and <i>tui</i>, rather than to <i>meus</i> and
  <i>tuus</i>, must consist in the quotation from the Anglo-Saxon of some
  <!-- Page 290 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page290"></a>[290]</span>text, wherein <i>min</i> or <i>þin</i>
  occurs with a feminine substantive, in an <i>oblique</i> case, the
  pronoun <i>preceding</i> the noun. When this has been done, it will be
  time enough to treat <i>mine</i> and <i>thine</i> as the equivalents to
  <i>mei</i> and <i>tui</i>, rather than as those to <i>meus</i> and
  <i>tuus</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE WEAK PRÆTERITE.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect408">§ 408</a>. The remote origin of the weak præterite
  in <i>-d</i> or <i>-t</i>, has been considered by Grimm. He maintains
  that it is the <i>d</i> in <i>d-d</i>, the reduplicate præterite of
  <i>do</i>. In all the Gothic languages the termination of the past tense
  is either <i>-da</i>, <i>-ta</i>, <i>-de</i>, <i>-ði</i>, <i>-d</i>,
  <i>-t</i>, or <i>-ed</i>, for the singular, and <i>-don</i>, <i>-ton</i>,
  <i>-tûmês</i>, or <i>-ðum</i>, for the plural; in other words, <i>d</i>,
  or an allied sound, appears once, if not oftener. In the <i>plural</i>
  præterite of the <i>M&oelig;so-Gothic</i>, however, we have something
  more, <i>viz.</i>, the termination <i>-dêdum</i>; as <i>nas-idêdum</i>,
  <i>nas-idêduþ</i>, <i>nas-idedun</i>, from <i>nas-ja</i>;
  <i>sôk-idêdum</i>, <i>sôk-idêduþ</i>, <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `sôk-iddêun'."><i>sôk-idêdun</i></span>, from
  <i>sôk-ja</i>; <i>salb-ôdedum</i>, <i>salb-ôdêduþ</i>,
  <i>salb-ôdêdun</i>, from <i>salbô</i>. Here there is a second <i>d</i>.
  The same takes place with the dual form <i>salb-ôdêduts</i>, and with the
  subjunctive forms, <i>salb-ôdêdjan</i>, <i>salb-ôdêduts</i>,
  <i>salb-ôdedi</i>, <i>salb-ôdêdeits</i>, <i>salb-ôdêdeima</i>,
  <i>salb-ôdedeiþ</i>, <i>salb-ôdedina</i>. The English phrase, <i>we did
  salve</i>, as compared with <i>salb-ôdedum</i>, is confirmatory of
  this.</p>

  <p><a name="sect409">§ 409</a>. Some remarks of Dr. Trithen's on the
  Slavonic præterite, in the "Transactions of the Philological Society,"
  induce me to prefer a different doctrine, and to identify the <i>-d</i>
  in words like <i>moved</i>, &amp;c., with the <i>-t</i> of the passive
  participles of the Latin language; as found in mon-<i>it</i>-us,
  voc-<i>at</i>-us, rap-<i>t</i>-us, and probably in Greek forms like <span
  title="tuph-th-eis" class="grk"
  >&tau;&upsilon;&phi;-&theta;-&epsilon;&#x1F77;&sigmaf;</span>. <!-- Page
  292 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page292"></a>[292]</span></p>

  <p>1. The Slavonic præterite is commonly said to possess genders: in
  other words, there is one form for speaking of a past action when done by
  a male, and another for speaking of a past action when done by a
  female.</p>

  <p>2. These forms are identical with those of the participles, masculine
  or feminine, as the case may be. Indeed the præterite is a participle.
  If, instead of saying <i>ille amavit</i>, the Latins said <i>ille
  amatus</i>, whilst, instead of saying <i>illa amavit</i>, they said
  <i>illa amata</i>, they would exactly use the grammar of the
  Slavonians.</p>

  <p>3. Hence, as one class of languages, at least, gives us the undoubted
  fact of an active præterite being identical with a passive participle,
  and as the participle and præterite in question are nearly identical, we
  have a fair reason for believing that the <i>d</i>, in the English active
  præterite, is the <i>d</i> of the participle, which in its turn, is the
  <i>t</i> of the Latin passive participle.</p>

  <p><a name="sect410">§ 410</a>. The following extract gives Dr. Trithen's
  remarks on the Slavonic verb in his own words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A peculiarity which distinguishes the grammar of all the Slavish
  languages, consists in the use of the past participle, taken in an active
  sense, for the purpose of expressing the præterite. This participle
  generally ends in <i>l</i>; and much uncertainty prevails both as to its
  origin and its relations, though the termination has been compared by
  various philologists with similar affixes in the Sanscrit, and the
  classical languages.</p>

  <p>"In the Old Slavish, or the language of the church, there are three
  methods of expressing the past tense: one of them consists in the union
  of the verb substantive with the participle; as,</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Old Slavish past tense." title="Old Slavish past tense.">
<tr><td class="spacsingle" style="width:50%"><i>Rek esm'</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="spacsingle" style="width:50%"><i>chital esmi'</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle"><i>Rek esi'</i></td><td class="spacsingle"><i>chital esi'</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle"><i>Rek est'</i></td><td class="spacsingle"><i>chital est'</i>.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>"In the corresponding tense of the Slavonic dialect we have the verb
  substantive placed before the participle: <!-- Page 293 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Slavonic past tense." title="Slavonic past tense.">

<tr><td class="spacsingle"><i>On ye imao</i></td><td class="spacsingle"><i>omi su imali</i>.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>"In the Polish it appears as a suffix:</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Polish past tense." title="Polish past tense.">
<tr><td class="spacsingle" style="width:50%"><i>Czytalem</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="spacsingle" style="width:50%"><i>czytalismy</i></td></tr>

<tr><td class="spacsingle"><i>Czytal</i></td><td class="spacsingle"><i>czytalie</i>.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>"And in the Servian it follows the participle:</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Servian past tense." title="Servian past tense.">
<tr><td class="spacsingle" style="width:50%"><i>Igrao sam</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td class="spacsingle" style="width:50%"><i>igrali smo</i></td></tr>

<tr><td class="spacsingle"><i>Igrao ye</i></td><td class="spacsingle"><i>igrali su</i>.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>"The ending <i>-ao</i>, of <i>igrao</i> and <i>imao</i>, stands for
  the Russian <i>al</i>, as in some English dialects a' is used for
  <i>all</i>."</p>

<h3>PART V.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SYNTAX.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON SYNTAX IN GENERAL.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect411">§ 411</a>. The word <i>syntax</i> is derived from
  the Greek <i>syn</i> (<i>with</i> or <i>together</i>) and <i>taxis</i>
  (<i>arrangement</i>). It relates to the arrangement, or putting together,
  of words. Two or more words must be used before there can be any
  application of syntax.</p>

  <p><i>There is to me a father.</i>&mdash;Here we have a circumlocution
  equivalent to <i>I have a father</i>. In the English language the
  circumlocution is unnatural. In the Latin it is common. To determine
  this, is a matter of idiom rather than of syntax.</p>

  <p><a name="sect412">§ 412</a>. In the English, as in all other
  languages, it is convenient to notice certain so-called figures of
  speech. They always furnish convenient modes of expression, and
  sometimes, as in the case of the one immediately about to be noticed,
  <i>account</i> for facts.</p>

  <p><a name="sect413">§ 413</a>. <i>Personification.</i>&mdash;The ideas
  of apposition and collectiveness account for the apparent violations of
  the concord of number. The idea of personification applies to the concord
  of gender. A masculine or feminine <!-- Page 295 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page295"></a>[295]</span>gender, characteristic
  of persons, may be substituted for the neuter gender, characteristic of
  things. In this case the term is said to be personified.</p>

  <p><i>The cities who aspired to liberty.</i>&mdash;A personification of
  the idea expressed by cities is here necessary to justify the
  expression.</p>

  <p><i>It</i>, the sign of the neuter gender, as applied to a male or
  female <i>child</i>, is the reverse of the process.</p>

  <p><a name="sect414">§ 414</a>. <i>Ellipsis</i> (from the Greek
  <i>elleipein</i> = <i>to fall short</i>), or a <i>falling short</i>,
  occurs in sentences like <i>I sent to the bookseller's</i>. Here the word
  <i>shop</i> or <i>house</i> is understood. Expressions like <i>to go on
  all fours</i>, and <i>to eat of the fruit of the tree</i>, are reducible
  to ellipses.</p>

  <p><a name="sect415">§ 415</a>. <i>Pleonasm</i> (from the Greek
  <i>pleoazein</i> = <i>to be in excess</i>) occurs in sentences like
  <i>the king, he reigns</i>. Here the word <i>he</i> is superabundant.</p>

  <p><i>My banks, they are furnished</i>,&mdash;<i>the most straitest
  sect</i>,&mdash;these are pleonastic expressions. In <i>the king, he
  reigns</i>, the word <i>king</i> is in the same predicament as in <i>the
  king, God bless him</i>.</p>

  <p>The double negative, allowed in Greek and Anglo-Saxon, but not
  admissible in English, is pleonastic.</p>

  <p>The verb <i>do</i>, in <i>I do speak</i>, is <i>not</i> pleonastic. In
  respect to the sense it adds intensity. In respect to the construction it
  is not in apposition, but in the same predicament with verbs like
  <i>must</i> and <i>should</i>, as in <i>I must go</i>, &amp;c.;
  <i>i.e.</i>, it is a verb followed by an infinitive. This we know from
  its power in those languages where the infinitive has a characteristic
  sign; as, in German,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Die Augen <i>thaten</i> ihm winken.&mdash;<span class="sc">Goethe.</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Besides this, <i>make</i> is similarly used in Old
  English,&mdash;<i>But men make draw the branch thereof, and beren him to
  be graffed at Babyloyne.</i>&mdash;Sir J. Mandeville.</p>

  <p><a name="sect416">§ 416</a>. <i>The figure zeugma.</i>&mdash;<i>They
  wear a garment <!-- Page 296 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page296"></a>[296]</span>like that of the Scythians, but a language
  peculiar to themselves.</i>&mdash;The verb, naturally applying to
  <i>garment</i> only, is here used to govern <i>language</i>. This is
  called in Greek, <i>zeugma</i> (junction).</p>

  <p><a name="sect417">§ 417</a>. <i>My paternal home was made desolate,
  and he himself was sacrificed.</i>&mdash;The sense of this is plain;
  <i>he</i> means <i>my father</i>. Yet no such substantive as
  <i>father</i> has gone before. It is supplied, however, from the word
  <i>paternal</i>. The sense indicated by <i>paternal</i> gives us a
  subject to which he can refer. In other words, the word <i>he</i> is
  understood, according to what is indicated, rather than according to what
  is expressed. This figure in Greek is called <i>pros to semainomenon</i>
  (<i>according to the thing indicated</i>).</p>

  <p><a name="sect418">§ 418</a>.&mdash;<i>Apposition,</i>&mdash;<i>Cæsar,
  the Roman emperor, invades Britain.</i>&mdash;-Here the words <i>Roman
  emperor</i> explain, or define, the word <i>Cæsar</i>; and the sentence,
  filled up, might stand, <i>Cæsar, that is, the Roman emperor</i>, &amp;c.
  Again, the <span class="correction" title="Original reads `word'."
  >words</span> <i>Roman emperor</i> might be wholly ejected; or, if not
  ejected, they might be thrown into a parenthesis. The practical bearing
  of this fact is exhibited by changing the form of the sentence, and
  inserting the conjunction <i>and</i>. In this case, instead of one
  person, two are spoken of, and the verb <i>invades</i> must be changed
  from the singular to the plural.</p>

  <p>Now the words <i>Roman emperor</i> are said to be in apposition to
  <i>Cæsar</i>. They constitute, not an additional idea, but an explanation
  of the original one. They are, as it were, <i>laid alongside</i>
  (<i>appositi</i>) of the word <i>Cæsar</i>. Cases of doubtful number,
  wherein two substantives precede a verb, and wherein it is uncertain
  whether the verb should be singular or plural, are decided by determining
  whether the substantives be in apposition or the contrary. No matter how
  many nouns there may be, as long as it <!-- Page 297 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page297"></a>[297]</span>can be shown that they
  are in apposition, the verb is in the singular number.</p>

  <p><a name="sect419">§ 419</a>. <i>Collectiveness as opposed to
  plurality.</i>&mdash;In sentences like <i>the meeting </i>was<i>
  large</i>, <i>the multitude </i>pursue<i> pleasure</i>, <i>meeting</i>
  and <i>multitude</i> are each collective nouns; that is, although they
  present the idea of a single object, that object consists of a plurality
  of individuals. Hence, <i>pursue</i> is put in the plural number. To say,
  however, <i>the meeting were large</i> would sound improper. The number
  of the verb that shall accompany a collective noun depends upon whether
  the idea of the multiplicity of individuals, or that of the unity of the
  aggregate, shall predominate.</p>

  <p><i>Sand and salt and a mass of iron </i>is<i> easier to bear than a
  man without understanding.</i>&mdash;Let <i>sand and salt and a mass of
  iron</i> be dealt with as a series of things the aggregate of which forms
  a mixture, and the expression is allowable.</p>

  <p><i>The king and the lords and commons </i>forms<i> an excellent frame
  of government.</i>&mdash;Here the expression is doubtful. Substitute
  <i>with</i> for the first <i>and</i>, and there is no doubt as to the
  propriety of the singular form <i>is</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect420">§ 420</a>. <i>The reduction of complex forms to
  simple ones.</i>&mdash;Take, for instance, the current illustration,
  viz., <i>the-king-of-Saxony's army</i>.&mdash;Here the assertion is, not
  that the army belongs to <i>Saxony</i>, but that it belongs to the
  <i>king of Saxony</i>; which words must, for the sake of taking a true
  view of the construction, be dealt with as a single word in the
  possessive case. Here two cases are dealt with as one; and a complex term
  is treated as a single word.</p>

  <p>The same reason applies to phrases like <i>the two king Williams</i>.
  If we say the <i>two kings William</i>, we must account for the phrase by
  apposition. <!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page298"></a>[298]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect421">§ 421</a>. <i>True notion of the part of speech in
  use.</i>&mdash;In <i>he is gone</i>, the word <i>gone</i> must be
  considered as equivalent to <i>absent</i>; that is, as an adjective.
  Otherwise the expression is as incorrect as the expression <i>she is
  eloped</i>. Strong participles are adjectival oftener than weak ones:
  their form being common to many adjectives.</p>

  <p><i>True notion of the original form.</i>&mdash;In the phrase <i>I must
  speak</i>, the word <i>speak</i> <span class="correction" title="Original reads `in'."
  >is</span> an infinitive. In the phrase <i>I am forced to speak</i>, the
  word <i>speak</i> is (in the present English) an infinitive also. In one
  case, however, it is preceded by <i>to</i>; whilst in the other, the
  particle <i>to</i> is absent. The reason for this lies in the original
  difference of form. <i>Speak</i> - <i>to</i> = the Anglo-Saxon
  <i>sprécan</i>, a simple infinitive; <i>to speak</i>, or <i>speak</i> +
  <i>to</i> = the Anglo-Saxon <i>to sprécanne</i>, an infinitive in the
  dative case.</p>

  <p><a name="sect422">§ 422</a>. <i>Convertibility.</i>&mdash;In the
  English language, the greater part of the words may, as far as their form
  is concerned, be one part of speech as well as another. Thus the
  combinations <i>s-a-n-th</i>, or <i>f-r-e-n-k</i>, if they existed at
  all, might exist as either nouns or verbs, as either substantives or
  adjectives, as conjunctions, adverbs, or prepositions. This is not the
  case in the Greek languages. There, if a word be a substantive, it will
  probably end in <i>-s</i>; if an infinitive verb, in <i>-ein</i>, &amp;c.
  The bearings of this difference between languages like the English and
  languages like the Greek will soon appear.</p>

  <p>At present, it is sufficient to say that a word, originally one part
  of speech (<i>e.g.</i>, a noun), may become another (<i>e.g.</i>, a
  verb). This may be called the convertibility of words.</p>

  <p>There is an etymological convertibility, and a syntactic
  convertibility; and although, in some cases, the <!-- Page 299 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page299"></a>[299]</span>line of demarcation is
  not easily drawn between them, the distinction is intelligible and
  convenient.</p>

  <p><a name="sect423">§ 423</a>. <i>Etymological
  convertibility.</i>&mdash;The words <i>then</i> and <i>than</i>, now
  adverbs or conjunctions, were once cases: in other words, they have been
  converted from one part of speech to another. Or, they may even be said
  to be cases, at the present moment; although only in an historical point
  of view. For the practice of language, they are not only adverbs or
  conjunctions, but they are adverbs or conjunctions exclusively.</p>

  <p><a name="sect424">§ 424</a>. <i>Syntactic
  convertibility.</i>&mdash;The combination <i>to err</i>, is at this
  moment an infinitive verb. Nevertheless it can be used as the equivalent
  to the substantive <i>error</i>.</p>

  <p><i>To err is human</i> = <i>error is human</i>. Now this is an
  instance of syntactic conversion. Of the two meanings, there is no doubt
  as to which is the primary one; which primary meaning is part and parcel
  of the language at this moment.</p>

  <p>The infinitive, when used as a substantive, can be used in a singular
  form only.</p>

  <p><i>To err</i> = <i>error</i>; but we have no such form as <i>to
  errs</i> = <i>errors</i>. Nor is it wanted. The infinitive, in a
  substantival sense, always conveys a general statement, so that even when
  singular, it has a plural power; just as <i>man is mortal</i> = <i>men
  are mortal</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect425">§ 425</a>. <i>The adjective used as a
  substantive.</i>&mdash;Of these, we have examples in expressions like the
  <i>blacks of Africa</i>&mdash;<i>the bitters and sweets of
  life</i>&mdash;<i>all fours were put to the ground</i>. These are true
  instances of conversion, and are proved to be so by the fact of their
  taking a plural form.</p>

  <p><i>Let the blind lead the blind</i> is not an instance of conversion.
  The word <i>blind</i> in both instances remains <!-- Page 300 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page300"></a>[300]</span>an adjective, and is
  shown to remain so by its being uninflected.</p>

  <p><a name="sect426">§ 426</a>. <i>Uninflected parts of speech, used as
  substantive.</i>&mdash;When King Richard III. says, <i>none of your
  ifs</i>, he uses the word <i>if</i> as a substantive = <i>expressions of
  doubt</i>.</p>

  <p>So in the expression <i>one long now</i>, the word <i>now</i> =
  <i>present time</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect427">§ 427</a>. The convertibility of words in English is
  very great; and it is so because the structure of the language favours
  it. As few words have any peculiar signs expressive of their being
  particular parts of speech, interchange is easy, and conversion follows
  the logical association of ideas unimpeded.</p>

  <p><i>The convertibility of words is in the inverse ratio to the amount
  of their inflection.</i></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">SYNTAX OF SUBSTANTIVES.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect428">§ 428</a>. The phenomena of convertibility have been
  already explained.</p>

  <p>The remaining points connected with the syntax of substantives, are
  chiefly points of ellipsis.</p>

  <p><i>Ellipsis of substantives.</i>&mdash;The historical view of phrases,
  like <i>Rundell and Bridge's</i>, <i>St. Paul's</i>, &amp;c., shows that
  this ellipsis is common to the English and the other Gothic languages.
  Furthermore, it shows that it is met with in languages not of the Gothic
  stock; and, finally, that the class of words to which it applies, is,
  there or thereabouts, the same generally.</p>

  <p><a name="sect429">§ 429</a>. The following phrases are referable to a
  different class of relations&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. <i>Right and left</i>&mdash;supply <i>hand</i>. This is, probably,
  a real ellipsis. The words <i>right</i> and <i>left</i>, have not yet
  become true substantives; inasmuch as they have no plural forms. In this
  respect they stand in contrast with <i>bitter</i> and <i>sweet</i>;
  inasmuch as we can say <i>he has tasted both the bitters and sweets of
  life</i>. Nevertheless, the expression can be refined on.</p>

  <p>2. <i>All fours</i>. <i>To go on all fours.</i> No ellipsis. The word
  <i>fours</i> is a true substantive, as proved by its existence as a
  plural.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">SYNTAX OF ADJECTIVES.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect430">§ 430</a>. <i>Pleonasm.</i>&mdash;Pleonasm can take
  place with adjectives only in the expression of the degrees of
  comparison. Over and above the etymological signs of the comparative and
  superlative degrees, there may be used the superlative words <i>more</i>
  and <i>most</i>.</p>

  <p>And this pleonasm really occurs&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>The </i>more serener<i> spirit</i>.</p>
      <p><i>The </i>most straitest<i> sect</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These are instances of pleonasm in the strictest sense of the
  term.</p>

  <p><a name="sect431">§ 431</a>. Collocation.&mdash;As a general rule, the
  adjective precedes the substantive&mdash;<i>a good man</i>, not <i>a man
  good</i>.</p>

  <p>When, however, the adjective is qualified by either the expression of
  its degree, or accompanied by another adjective, it may follow the
  substantive&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>A man <i>just and good</i>.</p>
      <p>A woman <i>wise and fair</i>.</p>
      <p>A hero <i>devoted to his country</i>.</p>
      <p>A patriot <i>disinterested to a great degree</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Single simple</i> adjectives thus placed after their substantive,
  belong to the poetry of England, and especially to the ballad
  poetry&mdash;<i>sighs profound</i>&mdash;<i>the leaves green</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect432">§ 432</a>. <i>Government.</i>&mdash;The only
  adjective that governs a case, is the word <i>like</i>. In the
  expression, <i>this is like <!-- Page 303 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page303"></a>[303]</span>him</i>, &amp;c., the original power of
  the dative remains. This we infer&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. From the fact that in most languages which have inflections to a
  sufficient extent, the word meaning <i>like</i> governs a dative
  case.</p>

  <p>2. That if ever we use in English any preposition at all to express
  similitude, it is the preposition <i>to</i>&mdash;<i>like to me</i>,
  <i>like to death</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Expressions like <i>full of meat</i>, <i>good for John</i>, are by no
  means instances of the government of adjectives; the really governing
  words being the prepositions <i>to</i> and <i>for</i> respectively.</p>

  <p><a name="sect433">§ 433</a>. The positive degree preceded by the
  adjective <i>more</i>, is equivalent to the comparative
  form&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, <i>more wise</i> = <i>wiser</i>.</p>

  <p>The reasons for employing one expression in preference to the other,
  depend upon the nature of the particular word used.</p>

  <p>When the word is at one and the same time of Anglo-Saxon origin and
  monosyllabic, there is no doubt about the preference to be given to the
  form in <i>-er</i>. Thus, <i>wis-er</i> is preferable to <i>more
  wise</i>.</p>

  <p>When, however, the word is compound, or trisyllabic, the combination
  with the word <i>more</i>, is preferable.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Comparative forms." title="Comparative forms.">
<tr><td class="spacsingle"><i>more fruitful</i></td><td class="spacsingle"><i>fruitfuller</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle"><i>more villainous</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td class="spacsingle"><span class="correction" title="Original reads `villanouser'."><i>villainouser</i></span>.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Between these two extremes there are several intermediate forms,
  wherein the use of one rather than another will depend upon the taste of
  the writer. The question, however, is a question of euphony, rather than
  of aught else. It is also illustrated by the principle of not multiplying
  secondary elements. In such a word as <i>fruit-full-er</i>, there are two
  additions to the root. The same is the case with the superlative,
  <i>fruit-full-est</i>. <!-- Page 304 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page304"></a>[304]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect434">§ 434</a>. In the Chapter on the Comparative Degree
  is indicated a refinement upon the current notions as to the power of the
  comparative degree, and reasons are given for believing that the
  fundamental notion expressed by the comparative inflexion is the idea of
  comparison or contrast between <i>two</i> objects.</p>

  <p>In this case, it is better in speaking of only two objects to use the
  comparative degree rather than the superlative&mdash;even when we use the
  definite article <i>the</i>. Thus&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>This is <i>the better</i> of the two</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>is preferable to</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>This is <i>the best</i> of the two.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This principle is capable of an application more extensive than our
  habits of speaking and writing will verify. Thus to go to other parts of
  speech, we should logically say&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Whether of the two,</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>rather than</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Which of the two.</p>

  <p>Either the father or the son,</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>but not</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Either the father, the son, or the daughter.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This statement may be refined on. It is chiefly made for the sake of
  giving fresh prominence to the idea of duality, expressed by the
  terminations <i>-er</i> and <i>-ter</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect435">§ 435</a>. The absence of inflection simplifies the
  syntax of adjectives. Violations of concord are impossible. We could not
  make an adjective disagree with its substantive if we wished.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">SYNTAX OF PRONOUNS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect436">§ 436</a>. <i>Pleonasm in the syntax of
  pronouns.</i>&mdash;In the following sentences the words in italics are
  pleonastic:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. The king <i>he</i> is just.</p>
      <p>2. I saw <i>her</i>, the queen.</p>
      <p>3. The <i>men</i>, they were there.</p>
      <p>4. The king, <i>his</i> crown.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Of these forms, the first is more common than the second and third,
  and the fourth more common than the first.</p>

  <p><a name="sect437">§ 437</a>. The fourth has another element of
  importance. It has given rise to the absurd notion that the genitive case
  in <i>-'s</i> (<i>father-'s</i>) is a contraction from <i>his</i>
  (<i>father his</i>).</p>

  <p>To say nothing about the inapplicability of this rule to feminine
  genders, and plural numbers, the whole history of the Indo-Germanic
  languages is against it.</p>

  <p>1. We cannot reduce <i>the queen's majesty</i> to <i>the queen his
  majesty</i>.</p>

  <p>2. We cannot reduce <i>the children's bread</i> to <i>the children his
  bread</i>.</p>

  <p>3. The Anglo-Saxon forms are in <i>-es</i>, not in <i>his</i>.</p>

  <p>4. The word <i>his</i> itself must be accounted for; and that cannot
  be done by assuming it to be <i>he</i> + <i>his</i>.</p>

  <p>5. The <i>-s</i> in <i>father's</i> is the <i>-is</i> in
  <i>patris</i>, and the <span title="-os" class="grk"
  >-&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> in <span title="pateros" class="grk"
  >&pi;&alpha;&tau;&#x1F73;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>. <!-- Page 306
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page306"></a>[306]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect438">§ 438</a>. The preceding examples illustrate an
  apparent paradox, <i>viz.</i>, the fact of pleonasm and ellipsis being
  closely allied. <i>The king he is just</i>, dealt with as a <i>single</i>
  sentence, is undoubtedly pleonastic. But it is not necessary to be
  considered as a mere simple sentence. <i>The king</i>&mdash;may represent
  a first sentence incomplete, whilst <i>he is just</i> represents a second
  sentence in full. What is pleonasm in a single sentence is ellipsis in a
  double one.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE TRUE PERSONAL PRONOUNS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect439">§ 439</a>. <i>Personal pronouns.</i>&mdash;The use
  of the second person plural instead of the second singular has been
  noticed already. This use of one number for another is current throughout
  the Gothic languages. A pronoun so used is conveniently called the
  <i>pronomen reverentiæ</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect440">§ 440</a>. <i>Dativus ethicus.</i>&mdash;In the
  phrase</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Rob me the exchequer,&mdash;<i>Henry IV.</i>,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>the <i>me</i> is expletive, and is equivalent to <i>for me</i>. This
  expletive use of the dative is conveniently called the <i>dativus
  ethicus</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect441">§ 441</a>. <i>The reflected personal
  pronoun.</i>&mdash;In the English language there is no equivalent to the
  Latin <i>se</i>, the German <i>sich</i>, and the Scandinavian <i>sik</i>,
  and <i>sig</i>.</p>

  <p>It follows from this that the word <i>self</i> is used to a greater
  extent than would otherwise be the case.</p>

  <p><i>I strike me</i> is awkward, but not ambiguous.</p>

  <p><i>Thou strikest thee</i> is awkward, but not ambiguous.</p>

  <p><i>He strikes him</i> is ambiguous; inasmuch as <i>him</i> may mean
  either the <i>person who strikes</i> or some one else. In order to be
  clear we add the word <i>self</i> when the idea is reflective. <i>He
  strikes himself</i> is, at once idiomatic and unequivocal.</p>

  <p>So it is with the plural persons.</p>

  <p><i>We strike us</i> is awkward, but not ambiguous. <!-- Page 308
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page308"></a>[308]</span></p>

  <p><i>Ye strike you</i> is the same.</p>

  <p><i>They strike them</i> is ambiguous.</p>

  <p>This shows the value of a reflective pronoun for the third person.</p>

  <p>As a general rule, therefore, whenever we use a verb reflectively we
  use the word <i>self</i> in combination with the personal pronoun.</p>

  <p>Yet this was not always the case. The use of the simple personal
  pronoun was current in Anglo-Saxon, and that, not only for the first two
  persons, but for the third as well.</p>

  <p>The exceptions to this rule are either poetical expressions, or
  imperative moods.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>He sat <i>him</i> down at a pillar's base.&mdash;<span class="sc">Byron.</span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Sit thee down.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><a name="sect442">§ 442</a>. <i>Reflective neuters.</i>&mdash;In the
  phrase <i>I strike me</i>, the verb <i>strike</i> is transitive; in other
  words, the word <i>me</i> expresses the object of an action, and the
  meaning is different from the meaning of the simple expression <i>I
  strike</i>.</p>

  <p>In the phrase <i>I fear me</i> (used by Lord Campbell in his lives of
  the Chancellors), the verb <i>fear</i> is intransitive or neuter; in
  other words, the word <i>me</i> (unless, indeed, <i>fear</i> mean
  <i>terrify</i>), expresses no object of any action at all; whilst the
  meaning is the same as in the simple expression <i>I fear</i>.</p>

  <p>Here the reflective pronoun appears out of place, <i>i.e.</i>, after a
  neuter or intransitive verb.</p>

  <p>Such a use, however, is but the fragment of an extensive system of
  reflective verbs thus formed, developed in different degrees in the
  different Gothic languages; but in all more than in the English.</p>

  <p><a name="sect443">§ 443</a>. <i>Equivocal reflectives.</i>&mdash;The
  proper place of the reflective is <i>after</i> the verb. <!-- Page 309
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309"></a>[309]</span></p>

  <p>The proper place of the governing pronoun is, in the indicative and
  subjunctive moods, <i>before</i> the verb.</p>

  <p>Hence in expressions like the preceding there is no doubt as to the
  power of the pronoun.</p>

  <p>The imperative mood, however, sometimes presents a complication. Here
  the governing person may follow the verb.</p>

  <p><i>Mount ye</i> = either <i>be mounted</i>, or <i>mount
  yourselves</i>. In phrases like this, and in phrases</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Busk ye, busk ye</i>, my bonny, bonny bride,</p>
      <p class="i4"><i>Busk ye, busk ye</i>, my winsome marrow,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>the construction is ambiguous. <i>Ye</i> may either be a nominative
  case governing the verb <i>busk</i>, or an accusative case governed by
  it.</p>

  <p>This is an instance of what may be called the <i>equivocal
  reflective</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect444">§ 444</a>. As <i>his</i> and <i>her</i> are genitive
  cases (and not adjectives), there is no need of explaining such
  combinations as <i>his mother</i>, <i>her father</i>, inasmuch as no
  concord of gender is expected. The expressions are respectively
  equivalent to</p>

  <p><a name="sect445">§ 445</a>. It has been stated that <i>its</i> is a
  secondary genitive, and it may be added, that it is of late origin in the
  language. The Anglo-Saxon form was <i>his</i>, the genitive of <i>he</i>
  for the neuter and masculine equally. Hence, when, in the old writers, we
  meet <i>his</i>, where we expect <i>its</i>, we must not suppose that any
  personification takes place, but simply that the old genitive common to
  the two genders is used in preference to the modern one limited to the
  neuter, and irregularly formed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE WORD SELF.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect446">§ 446</a>. The undoubted constructions of the word
  <i>self</i>, in the present state of the cultivated English, are
  threefold.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Government.</i>&mdash;In <i>my-self</i>, <i>thy-self</i>,
  <i>our-selves</i>, and <i>your-selves</i>, the construction is that of a
  common substantive with an adjective or genitive case. <i>My-self</i> =
  <i>my individuality</i>, and is similarly construed&mdash;<i>mea
  individualitas</i> (or <i>persona</i>), or <i>mei individualitas</i> (or
  <i>persona</i>).</p>

  <p>2. <i>Apposition.</i>&mdash;In <i>him-self</i> and <i>them-selves</i>,
  when accusative, the construction is that of a substantive in apposition
  with a pronoun. <i>Himself</i> = <i>him</i>, <i>the individual</i>.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Composition.</i>&mdash;It is only, however, when <i>himself</i>
  and <i>themselves</i>, are in the <i>accusative</i> case, that the
  construction is appositional. When they are used as <i>nominatives</i>,
  it must be explained on another principle. In phrases like</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>He himself</i> was present</p>
      <p><i>They themselves</i> were present,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>there is neither apposition nor government; <i>him</i> and
  <i>them</i>, being neither related to <i>my</i> and <i>thy</i>, so as to
  be governed, nor yet to <i>he</i> and <i>they</i>, so as to form an
  apposition. In order to come under one of these conditions, the phrases
  should be either <i>he his self</i> (<i>they <!-- Page 313 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page313"></a>[313]</span>their selves</i>), or
  else <i>he he self</i> (<i>they they selves</i>). In this difficulty, the
  only logical view that can be taken of the matter, is to consider the
  words <i>himself</i> and <i>themselves</i>, not as two words, but as a
  single word compounded; and even then, the compound will be of an
  irregular kind; inasmuch as the inflectional element <i>-m</i> is dealt
  with as part and parcel of the root.</p>

  <p><a name="sect447">§ 447</a>. <i>Her-self</i>.&mdash;The construction
  here is ambiguous. It is one of the preceding constructions. Which,
  however it is, is uncertain; since <i>her</i> may be either a so-called
  genitive, like <i>my</i>, or an accusative like <i>him</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Itself</i>&mdash;is also ambiguous. The <i>s</i> may represent the
  <i>-s</i> in <i>its</i>, as well as the <i>s-</i> in <i>self</i>.</p>

  <p>This inconsistency is as old as the Anglo-Saxon stage of the English
  language.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect448">§ 448</a>. The possessive pronouns fall into two
  classes. The first contains the forms like <i>my</i> and <i>thy</i>,
  &amp;c.; the second, those like <i>mine</i> and <i>thine</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>My</i>, <i>thy</i>, <i>his</i> (as in <i>his book</i>), <i>her</i>,
  <i>its</i> (as in <i>its book</i>), <i>our</i>, <i>your</i>,
  <i>their</i>, are conveniently considered as the equivalents to the Latin
  forms <i>mei</i>, <i>tui</i>, <i>ejus</i>, <i>nostrum</i>,
  <i>vestrum</i>, <i>eorum</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Mine</i>, <i>thine</i>, <i>his</i> (as in <i>the book is his</i>),
  <i>hers</i>, <i>ours</i>, <i>yours</i>, <i>theirs</i> are conveniently
  considered as the equivalents to the Latin forms <i>meus</i>, <i>mea</i>,
  <i>meum</i>; <i>tuus</i>, <i>tua</i>, <i>tuum</i>; <i>suus</i>,
  <i>sua</i>, <i>suum</i>; <i>noster</i>, <i>nostra</i>, <i>nostrum</i>;
  <i>vester</i>, <i>vestra</i>, <i>vestrum</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect449">§ 449</a>. There is a difference between the
  construction of <i>my</i> and <i>mine</i>. We cannot say <i>this is mine
  hat</i>, and we cannot say <i>this hat is my</i>. Nevertheless, this
  difference is not explained by any change of construction from that of
  adjectives to that of cases. As far as the syntax is concerned the
  construction of <i>my</i> and <i>mine</i> is equally that of an adjective
  <i>agreeing</i> with a substantive, and of a genitive (or possessive)
  case <i>governed</i> by a substantive.</p>

  <p>Now a common genitive case can be used in two ways; either as part of
  a term, or as a whole term (<i>i.e.</i>, absolutely).&mdash;1. As part of
  a term&mdash;<i>this is John's hat</i>. 2. As a whole term&mdash;<i>this
  hat is John's</i>. <!-- Page 315 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page315"></a>[315]</span></p>

  <p>And a common adjective can be used in two ways; either as part of a
  term, or as a whole term (<i>i.e.</i> absolutely).&mdash;1. As part of a
  term&mdash;<i>these are good hats</i>. 2. As a whole term&mdash;<i>these
  hats are good</i>.</p>

  <p>Now whether we consider <i>my</i>, and the words like it, as
  adjectives or cases, they possess only <i>one</i> of the properties just
  illustrated, <i>i.e.</i>, they can only be used as part of a
  term&mdash;<i>this is my hat</i>; not <i>this hat is my</i>.</p>

  <p>And whether we consider <i>mine</i>, and the words like it, as
  adjectives or cases, they possess only <i>one</i> of the properties just
  illustrated, <i>i.e.</i>, they can only be used as whole terms, or
  absolutely&mdash;<i>this hat is mine</i>; not <i>this is mine
  hat</i>.</p>

  <p>For a full and perfect construction whether of an adjective or a
  genitive case, the possessive pronouns present the phenomenon of being,
  singly, incomplete, but, nevertheless, complementary to each other when
  taken in their two forms.</p>

  <p><a name="sect450">§ 450</a>. In the absolute construction of a
  genitive case, the term is formed by the single word, only so far as the
  <i>expression</i> is concerned. A substantive is always <i>understood</i>
  from what has preceded.&mdash;<i>This discovery is Newton's</i> = <i>this
  discovery is Newton's discovery</i>.</p>

  <p>The same with adjectives.&mdash;<i>This weather is fine</i> = <i>this
  weather is fine weather</i>.</p>

  <p>And the same with absolute pronouns.&mdash;<i>This hat is mine</i> =
  <i>this hat is my hat</i>; and <i>this is a hat of mine</i> = <i>this is
  a hat of my hats</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect451">§ 451</a>. In respect to all matters of syntax
  considered exclusively, it is so thoroughly a matter of indifference
  whether a word be an adjective or a genitive case that Wallis considers
  the forms in <i>-'s</i>, like <i>father's</i>, not as genitive cases but
  as adjectives. Looking to the logic of the question alone he is right,
  and looking to the <!-- Page 316 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page316"></a>[316]</span>practical syntax of the question he is
  right also. He is only wrong on the etymological side of the
  question.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE RELATIVE PRONOUNS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect452">§ 452</a>. It is necessary that the relative be in
  the same <i>gender</i> as the antecedent&mdash;<i>the man
  who</i>&mdash;<i>the woman who</i>&mdash;<i>the thing which</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect453">§ 453</a>. It is necessary that the relative be in
  the same <i>number</i> with the antecedent.</p>

  <p><a name="sect454">§ 454</a>. It is <i>not</i> necessary for the
  relative to be in the same <i>case</i> with its antecedent.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. John, <i>who</i> trusts me, comes here.</p>
      <p>2. John, <i>whom</i> I trust, comes here.</p>
      <p>3. John, <i>whose</i> confidence I possess, comes here.</p>
      <p>4. I trust John <i>who</i> trusts me.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><a name="sect455">§ 455</a>. The reason why the relative must agree
  with its antecedent in both number and gender, whilst it need not agree
  with it in case, is found in the following observations.</p>

  <p>1. All sentences containing a relative contain two verbs&mdash;<i>John
  who</i> (1) <i>trusts me</i> (2) <i>comes here</i>.</p>

  <p>2. Two verbs express two actions&mdash;(1) <i>trust</i> (2)
  <i>come</i>.</p>

  <p>3. Whilst, however, the actions are two in number, the person or thing
  which does or suffers them is single&mdash;<i>John</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="correction" title="Original reads `3.'.">4.</span>
  <i>He</i> (<i>she</i> or <i>it</i>) is single <i>ex vi termini</i>. The
  relative expresses the <i>identity</i> between the subjects (or objects)
  <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page318"></a>[318]</span>of the two actions. Thus <i>who</i> =
  <i>John</i>, or is another name for John.</p>

  <p>5. Things and persons that are one and the same, are of one and the
  same gender. The <i>John</i> who <i>trusts</i> is necessarily of the same
  gender with the <i>John</i> who <i>comes</i>.</p>

  <p>6. Things and persons that are one and the same, are of one and the
  same number. The number of <i>Johns</i> who <i>trust</i>, is the same as
  the number of <i>Johns</i> who <i>come</i>. Both these elements of
  concord are immutable.</p>

  <p>7. But a third element of concord is not immutable. The person or
  thing that is an agent in the one part of the sentence, may be the object
  of an action in the other. The <i>John</i> whom I <i>trust</i> may
  <i>trust</i> me also. Hence</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>a.</i> I trust John&mdash;<i>John</i> the object.</p>
      <p><i>b.</i> John trusts me&mdash;<i>John</i> the agent.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><a name="sect456">§ 456</a>. As the relative is only the antecedent in
  another form, it may change its case according to the construction.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. I trust John&mdash;(2) <i>John</i> trusts me.</p>
      <p>2. I trust John&mdash;(2) <i>He</i> trusts me.</p>
      <p>3. I trust John&mdash;(2) <i>Who</i> trusts me.</p>
      <p>4. John trusts me&mdash;(2) I trust <i>John</i>.</p>
      <p>5. John trusts me&mdash;(2) I trust <i>him</i>.</p>
      <p>6. John trusts me&mdash;(2) I trust <i>whom</i>.</p>
      <p>7. John trusts me&mdash;(2) <i>Whom</i> I trust.</p>
      <p>8. John&mdash;(2) <i>Whom</i> I trust trusts me.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><a name="sect457">§ 457</a>. <i>The books I want are
  here</i>.&mdash;This is a specimen of a true ellipsis. In all such
  phrases in <i>full</i>, there are <i>three</i> essential elements.</p>

  <p>1. The first proposition; as <i>the books are here</i>.</p>

  <p>2. The second proposition; as <i>I want</i>.</p>

  <p>3. The word which connects the two propositions, and without which,
  they naturally make separate, independent, unconnected statements. <!--
  Page 319 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page319"></a>[319]</span></p>

  <p>Now, although true and unequivocal ellipses are scarce, the preceding
  is one of the most unequivocal kind&mdash;the word which connects the two
  propositions being wanting.</p>

  <p><a name="sect458">§ 458</a>. <i>When there are two words in a clause,

  unexceptionable.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Solomon the son of David who built the temple</i>.&mdash;This is

  <p><i>Direct.</i>&mdash;Who is he?</p>

  <p><i>Oblique.</i>&mdash;Who do you say that he is?</p>

  <p>All difficulties about the cases of the interrogative pronoun may be

  which the interrogative coincides. Whatever be the case of this word will
  also be the case of the interrogative.</p>

  <p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;And, if necessary, it should be made in full. Thus
  the full answer to <i>whom do you say that they seek?</i> is, <i>I say
  that they seek him.</i></p>

  <p><a name="sect460">§ 460</a>. Nevertheless, such expressions as <i>whom
  do <!-- Page 321 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE RECIPROCAL CONSTRUCTION.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect461">§ 461</a>. In all sentences containing the statement
  of a reciprocal or mutual action there are in reality two assertions,
  <i>viz.</i>, the assertion that A. <i>strikes</i> (or <i>loves</i>) B.,
  and the assertion that B. <i>strikes</i> (or <i>loves</i>) A.; the action
  forming one, the reaction another. Hence, if the expressions exactly
  coincided with the fact signified, there would always be two
  propositions. This, however, is not the habit of language. Hence arises a
  more compendious form of expression, giving origin to an ellipsis of a
  peculiar kind. Phrases like <i>Eteocles and Polynices killed each
  other</i> are elliptical, for <i>Eteocles and Polynices killed&mdash;each
  the other</i>. Here the second proposition expands and explains the
  first, whilst the first supplies the verb to the second. Each, however,
  is elliptic.</p>

  <p><a name="sect462">§ 462</a>. This is the syntax. As to the power of
  the words <i>each</i> and <i>one</i> in the expression (<i>each other</i>
  and <i>one another</i>), I am not prepared to say that in the common
  practice of the English language there is any distinction between them. A
  distinction, however, if it existed, would give strength to our language.
  Where two persons performed a reciprocal action on another, the
  expression might be <i>one another</i>; as <i>Eteocles and Polynices
  killed one another</i>. Where more than two persons were engaged on each
  side of a reciprocal action, <!-- Page 323 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page323"></a>[323]</span>the expression might be <i>each other</i>;
  as, <i>the ten champions praised each other</i>.</p>

  <p>This amount of perspicuity is attained, by different processes, in the
  French, Spanish, and Scandinavian languages.</p>

  <p>1. French.&mdash;<i>Ils</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, A. and B.) <i>se
  battaient&mdash;l'un l'autre.</i> <i>Ils</i> (A. B. C.) <i>se
  battaient&mdash;les uns les autres.</i> In Spanish, <i>uno otro</i> =
  <i>l'un l'autre</i>, and <i>unos otros</i> = <i>les uns les
  autres</i>.</p>

  <p>2. Danish.&mdash;<i>Hin</i>ander = the French <i>l'un l'autre</i>;

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE INDETERMINATE PRONOUNS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect463">§ 463</a>. Different nations have different methods
  of expressing indeterminate propositions.</p>

  <p>Sometimes it is by the use of the passive voice. This is the common
  method in Latin and Greek, and is also current in
  English&mdash;<i>dicitur</i>, <span title="legetai" class="grk"
  >&lambda;&#x1F73;&gamma;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;</span>, <i>it is
  said</i>.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the verb is reflective&mdash;<i>si dice</i> = <i>it says
  itself</i>, Italian.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the plural pronoun of the third person is used. This also is
  an English locution&mdash;<i>they say</i> = <i>the world at large
  says</i>.</p>

  <p>Finally, the use of some word = <i>man</i> is a common indeterminate
  expression.</p>

  <p>The word <i>man</i> has an indeterminate sense in the Modern German;
  as <i>man sagt</i> = <i>they say</i>.</p>

  <p>The word <i>man</i> was also used indeterminately in the Old English,
  although it is not so used in the Modern.</p>

  <p>In the Old English, the form <i>man</i> often lost the <i>-n</i>, and
  became <i>me</i>.&mdash;"Deutsche Grammatik." This form is also
  extinct.</p>

  <p><a name="sect464">§ 464</a>. The present indeterminate pronoun is
  <i>one</i>; as <i>one says</i> = <i>they say</i> = <i>it is said</i> =
  <i>man sagt</i>, German = <i>on dit</i>, French = <i>si dice</i>,
  Italian.</p>

  <p>It has been stated, that the indeterminate pronoun <i>one</i> has no
  etymological connection with the numeral <i>one</i>; but that it is
  derived from the French <i>on</i> = <i>homme</i> <!-- Page 325 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page325"></a>[325]</span>= <i>homo</i> =
  <i>man</i>; and that it has replaced the Old English <i>man</i> or
  <i>me</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect465">§ 465</a>. Two other pronouns, or, to speak more in
  accordance with the present habit of the English language, one pronoun,
  and one adverb of pronominal origin, are also used indeterminately,
  <i>viz.</i>, <i>it</i> and <i>there</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect466">§ 466</a>. <i>It</i> can be either the subject or
  the predicate of a sentence,&mdash;<i>it is this</i>, <i>this is it</i>,
  <i>I am it</i>, <i>it is I</i>. When <i>it</i> is the subject of a
  proposition, the verb necessarily agrees with it, and can be of the
  singular number only; no matter what be the number of the
  predicate&mdash;<i>it is this</i>, <i>it is these</i>.</p>

  <p>When <i>it</i> is the predicate of a proposition, the number of the
  verb depends upon the number of the subject. These points of universal
  syntax are mentioned here for the sake of illustrating some anomalous
  forms.</p>

  <p><a name="sect467">§ 467</a>. <i>There</i> can only be the predicate of
  a subject. It differs from <i>it</i> in this respect. It follows also
  that it must differ from <i>it</i> in never affecting the number of the
  verb. This is determined by the nature of the subject&mdash;<i>there is
  this</i>, <i>there are these</i>.</p>

  <p>When we say <i>there is these</i>, the analogy between the words
  <i>these</i> and <i>it</i> misleads us; the expression being
  illogical.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, although a predicate, <i>there</i> always stands in the
  beginning of propositions, <i>i.e.</i>, in the place of the subject. This
  also misleads.</p>

  <p><a name="sect468">§ 468</a>. Although <i>it</i>, when the subject,
  being itself singular, absolutely requires that its verb should be
  singular also, there is a tendency to use it incorrectly, and to treat it
  as a plural. Thus, in German, when the predicate is plural, the verb
  joined to the singular form <i>es</i> ( = <i>it</i>) is
  plural&mdash;<i>es sind menschen</i>, literally translated = <i>it are
  men</i>; which, though bad English, is good German.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE ARTICLES.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect469">§ 469</a>. The rule of most practical importance
  about the articles is the rule that determines when the article shall be
  repeated as often as there is a fresh substantive, and when it shall
  not.</p>

  <p>When two or more substantives following each other denote the same
  object, the article precedes the first only. We say, <i>the secretary and
  treasurer</i> (or, <i>a secretary and treasurer</i>), when the two
  offices are held by one person.</p>

  <p>When two or more substantives following each other denote different
  objects, the article is repeated, and precedes each. We say, <i>the</i>
  (or <i>a</i>) <i>secretary and the</i> (or <i>a</i>) <i>treasurer</i>,
  when the two offices are held by different persons.</p>

  <p>This rule is much neglected.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE NUMERALS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect470">§ 470</a>. The numeral <i>one</i> is naturally
  single. All the rest are naturally plural.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless such expressions&mdash;<i>one two</i> ( = <i>one
  collection of two</i>), <i>two threes</i> ( = <i>two collections of
  three</i>) are legitimate. These are so, because the sense of the word is
  changed. We may talk of several <i>ones</i> just as we may talk of
  several <i>aces</i>; and of <i>one two</i> just as of <i>one
  pair</i>.</p>

  <p>Expressions like <i>the thousand-and-first</i> are incorrect. They
  mean neither one thing nor another: 1001st being expressed by <i>the
  thousand-and-first</i>, and 1000th + 1st being expressed by <i>the
  thousandth and the first</i>.</p>

  <p>Here it may be noticed that, although I never found it to do so, the
  word <i>odd</i> is capable of taking an ordinal form. The
  <i>thousand-and-odd-th</i> is as good an expression as the
  <i>thousand-and-eight-th</i>.</p>

  <p>The construction of phrases like the <i>thousand-and-first</i> is the
  same construction as we find in the <i>king of Saxony's army</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect471">§ 471</a>. It is by no means a matter of
  indifference whether we say the <i>two first</i> or the <i>first
  two</i>.</p>

  <p>The captains of two different classes at school should be called the
  <i>two first boys</i>. The first and second boys of the same class should
  be called the <i>first two boys</i>. I believe that when this rule is
  attended to, more is due to the printer than to the author: such, at
  least, is the case with myself.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON VERBS IN GENERAL.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect472">§ 472</a>. For the purposes of syntax it is
  necessary to divide verbs into the five following divisions: transitive,
  intransitive, auxiliary, substantive, and impersonal.</p>

  <p><i>Transitive verbs.</i>&mdash;In transitive verbs the action is never
  a simple action. It always affects some object or other,&mdash;<i>I move
  my limbs</i>; <i>I strike my enemy</i>. The presence of a transitive verb
  implies also the presence of a noun; which noun is the name of the object
  affected. A transitive verb, unaccompanied by a noun, either expressed or
  understood, is a contradiction in terms. The absence of the nouns, in and
  of itself, makes it intransitive. <i>I move</i> means, simply, <i>I am in
  a state of moving</i>. <i>I strike</i> means, simply, <i>I am in the act
  of striking</i>. Verbs like <i>move</i> and <i>strike</i> are naturally
  transitive.</p>

  <p><i>Intransitive verbs.</i>&mdash;An act may take place, and yet no
  object be affected by it. <i>To hunger</i>, <i>to thirst</i>, <i>to
  sleep</i>, <i>to wake</i>, are verbs that indicate states of being,
  rather than actions affecting objects. Verbs like <i>hunger</i> and
  <i>sleep</i> are naturally intransitive.</p>

  <p>Many verbs, naturally transitive, may be used as
  intransitive,&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, <i>I move</i>, <i>I strike</i>,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Many verbs, naturally intransitive, may be used as
  transitives,&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, <i>I walked the horse</i> = <i>I made the
  horse walk</i>.</p>

  <p>This variation in the use of one and the same verb <!-- Page 329
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page329"></a>[329]</span>is of much
  importance in the question of the government of verbs.</p>

  <p>A. Transitive verbs are naturally followed by some noun or other; and
  that noun is <i>always</i> the name of something affected by them <i>as
  an object</i>.</p>

  <p>B. Intransitive verbs are not naturally followed by any noun at all;
  and when they are so followed, the noun is <i>never</i> the name of
  anything affected by them <i>as an object</i>.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, intransitive verbs may be followed by nouns denoting the
  manner, degree, or instrumentality of their action,&mdash;<i>I walk with
  my feet</i> = <i>incedo pedibus</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect473">§ 473</a>. <i>The auxiliary verbs</i> will be
  noticed fully in Chapter <a href="#sect491">XXIII</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect474">§ 474</a>. The verb <i>substantive</i> has this
  peculiarity, <i>viz.</i>, that for all purposes of syntax it is no verb
  at all. <i>I speak</i> may, logically, be reduced to <i>I am
  speaking</i>; in which case it is only the <i>part</i> of a verb.
  Etymologically, indeed, the verb substantive is a verb; inasmuch as it is
  inflected as such: but for the purposes of construction, it is a copula
  only, <i>i.e.</i>, it merely denotes the agreement or disagreement
  between the subject and the predicate.</p>

  <p>For the <i>impersonal</i> verbs see Chapter <a
  href="#sect489">XXI</a>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE CONCORD OF VERBS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect475">§ 475</a>. The verb must agree with its subject in
  person, <i>I walk</i>, not <i>I walks</i>: <i>he walks</i>, not <i>he
  walk</i>.</p>

  <p>It must also agree with it in number,&mdash;<i>we walk</i>, not <i>we
  walks</i>: <i>he walks</i>, not <i>he walk</i>.</p>

  <p>Clear as these rules are, they require some expansion before they
  become sufficient to solve all the doubtful points of English syntax
  connected with the concord of the verb.</p>

  <p>A. <i>It is I, your master, who command you</i>. Query? would <i>it is
  I, your master, who commands you</i>, be correct? This is an example of a
  disputed point of concord in respect to the person of the verb.</p>

  <p>B. <i>The wages of sin is death</i>. Query? would <i>the wages of sin
  </i>are<i> death</i> be correct? This is an example of a disputed point
  of concord in respect to the number of the verb.</p>

  <p><a name="sect476">§ 476</a>. In respect to the concord of person the
  following rules will carry us through a portion of the difficulties.</p>

  <p><i>Rule.</i>&mdash;In sentences where there is but one proposition,
  when a noun and a pronoun of different persons are in apposition, the
  verb agrees with the first of them,&mdash;<i>I, your master, command
  you</i> (not <i>commands</i>): <i>your master, I, commands you</i> (not
  <i>command</i>).</p>

  <p>To understand the nature of the difficulty, it is <!-- Page 331
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page331"></a>[331]</span>necessary to
  remember that subjects may be extremely complex as well as perfectly
  simple; and that a complex subject may contain, at one and the same time,
  a noun substantive and a pronoun,&mdash;<i>I, the keeper</i>; <i>he, the
  merchant</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Now all noun-substantives are naturally of the third
  person&mdash;<i>John speaks</i>, <i>the men run</i>, <i>the commander
  gives orders</i>. Consequently the verb is of the third person also.</p>

  <p>But the pronoun with which such a noun-substantive may be placed in
  apposition, may be a pronoun of either person, the first or second:
  <i>I</i> or <i>thou</i>&mdash;<i>I the commander</i>&mdash;<i>thou the
  commander</i>.&mdash;In this case the construction requires
  consideration. With which does the verb agree? with the substantive which
  requires a third person? or with the pronoun which requires a first or
  second?</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly the idea which comes first is the leading idea; and,
  undoubtedly, the idea which explains, qualifies, or defines it, is the
  subordinate idea: and, undoubtedly, it is the leading idea which
  determines the construction of the verb. We may illustrate this from the
  analogy of a similar construction in respect to number&mdash;<i>a man
  with a horse and a gig meets me on the road</i>. Here the ideas are
  three; nevertheless the verb is singular. No addition of subordinate
  elements interferes with the construction that is determined by the
  leading idea. In the expression <i>I, your master</i>, the ideas are two;
  <i>viz.</i>, the idea expressed by <i>I</i>, and the idea expressed by
  <i>master</i>. Nevertheless, as the one only explains or defines the
  other, the construction is the same as if the idea were single. <i>Your
  master, I</i>, is in the same condition. The general statement is made
  concerning the <i>master</i>, and it is intended to say what <i>he</i>
  does. The word <i>I</i> merely <!-- Page 332 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page332"></a>[332]</span>defines the expression by stating who the
  master is. Of the two expressions the latter is the awkwardest. The
  construction, however, is the same for both.</p>

  <p>From the analysis of the structure of complex subjects of the kind in
  question, combined with a rule concerning the position of the subject,
  which will soon be laid down, I believe that, for all single
  propositions, the foregoing rule is absolute.</p>

  <p><i>Rule.</i>&mdash;In all single propositions the verb agrees in
  person with the noun (whether substantive or pronoun) which comes
  first.</p>

  <p><a name="sect477">§ 477</a>. But the expression <i>it is I your
  master, who command</i> (or <i>commands</i>) you, is not a single
  proposition. It is a sentence containing two propositions.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. <i>It is I.</i></p>
      <p>2. <i>Who commands you.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here the word <i>master</i> is, so to say, undistributed. It may
  belong to either clause of the sentence, <i>i.e.</i>, the whole sentence
  may be divided into</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Either&mdash;<i>it is I your master</i>&mdash;</p>
      <p>Or&mdash;<i>your master who commands you</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This is the first point to observe. The next is that the verb in the
  second clause (<i>command</i> or <i>commands</i>) is governed, not by
  either the personal pronoun or the substantive, but by the relative,
  <i>i.e.</i>, in the particular case before us, not by either <i>I</i> or
  <i>master</i>, but by <i>who</i>.</p>

  <p>And this brings us to the following question&mdash;with which of the
  two antecedents does the <i>relative</i> agree? with <i>I</i> or with
  <i>master</i>?</p>

  <p>This may be answered by the two following rules;&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Rule 1.</i>&mdash;When the two antecedents are in the <!-- Page 333
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page333"></a>[333]</span>same
  proposition, the relative agrees with the first. Thus&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. It is <i>I</i> your <i>master</i>&mdash;</p>
      <p>2. Who <i>command</i> you.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Rule 2.</i>&mdash;When the two antecedents are in different
  propositions, the relative agrees with the second. Thus&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. It is <i>I</i>&mdash;</p>
      <p>2. Your <i>master</i> who <i>commands</i> you.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This, however, is not all. What determines whether the two antecedents
  shall be in the same or in different propositions? I believe that the
  following rules for what may be called <i>the distribution of the
  substantive antecedent</i> will bear criticism.</p>

  <p><i>Rule 1.</i> That when there is any natural connection between the
  substantive antecedent and the verb governed by the relative, the
  antecedent belongs to the second clause. Thus, in the expression just
  quoted, the word <i>master</i> is logically connected with the word
  <i>command</i>; and this fact makes the expression, <i>It is I your
  master who commands you</i> the better of the two.</p>

  <p><i>Rule 2.</i> That when there is no natural connection between the
  substantive antecedent and the verb governed by the relative, the
  antecedent belongs to the first clause. <i>It is I, John, who command</i>
  (not <i>commands</i>) <i>you</i>.</p>

  <p>To recapitulate, the train of reasoning has been as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The person of the second verb is the person of the relative.</p>

  <p>2. The person of the relative is that of one of two antecedents.</p>

  <p>3. Of such two antecedents the relative agrees with the one which
  stands in the same proposition with itself. <!-- Page 334 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page334"></a>[334]</span></p>

  <p>4. Which position is determined by the connection or want of
  connection between the substantive antecedent and the verb governed by
  the relative.</p>

  <p>Respecting the person of the verb in the <i>first</i> proposition of a
  complex sentence there is no doubt. <i>I, your master, who commands you
  to make haste, am</i> (not <i>is</i>) <i>in a hurry.</i> Here, <i>I am in
  a hurry</i> is the first proposition; <i>who commands you to make
  haste</i>, the second.</p>

  <p>It is not difficult to see why the construction of sentences
  consisting of two propositions is open to an amount of latitude which is
  not admissible in the construction of single propositions. As long as the
  different parts of a complex idea are contained within the limits of a
  single proposition, their subordinate character is easily discerned.
  When, however, they amount to whole propositions, they take the
  appearance of being independent members of the sentence.</p>

  <p><a name="sect478">§ 478</a>. <i>The concord of number.</i>&mdash;It is
  believed that the following three rules will carry us through all
  difficulties of the kind just exhibited.</p>

  <p><i>Rule 1.</i> That the verb agrees with the subject, and with nothing
  but the subject. The only way to justify such an expression as <i>the
  wages of sin is death</i>, is to consider <i>death</i> not as the
  subject, but as the predicate; in other words, to consider the
  construction to be, <i>death is the wages of sin</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Rule 2.</i> That, except in the case of the word <i>there</i>, the
  word which comes first is generally the subject.</p>

  <p><i>Rule 3.</i> That no number of connected singular nouns can govern a
  plural verb, unless they be connected by a copulative conjunction. <i>The
  sun </i>and<i> moon shine</i>,&mdash;<i>the sun </i>in conjunction
  with<i> the moon shines</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect479">§ 479</a>. <i>Plural subjects with singular
  predicates.</i>&mdash;- <!-- Page 335 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page335"></a>[335]</span>The wages of sin <i>are</i>
  death.&mdash;Honest men <i>are</i> the salt of the earth.</p>

  <p><i>Singular subjects with plural predicates.</i>&mdash;These
  constructions are rarer than the preceding: inasmuch as two or more
  persons (or things) are oftener spoken of as being equivalent to one,
  than one person (or thing) is spoken of as being equivalent to two or
  more.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE GOVERNMENT OF VERBS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect480">§ 480</a>. The government of verbs is of two sorts,
  (1.) <i>objective</i>, and (2.) <i>modal</i>.</p>

  <p>It is objective where the noun which follows the verb is the name of
  some object affected by the action of the verb,&mdash;as <i>he strikes
  me</i>; <i>he wounds the enemy</i>.</p>

  <p>It is modal when the noun which follows the verb is not the name of
  any object affected by the verb, but the name of some object explaining
  the manner in which the action of the verb takes place, the instrument
  with which it is done, the end for which it is done, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The government of all transitive verbs is necessarily objective. It
  may also be modal,&mdash;<i>I strike the enemy with the sword</i> =
  <i>ferio hostem gladio</i>.</p>

  <p>The government of all intransitive verbs can only be modal,&mdash;<i>I
  walk with the stick</i>. When we say, <i>I walk the horse</i>, the word
  <i>walk</i> has changed its meaning, and signifies <i>make to walk</i>,
  and is, by the very fact of its being followed by the name of an object,
  converted from an intransitive into a transitive verb.</p>

  <p>The modal construction may also be called the <i>adverbial
  construction</i>; because the effect of the noun is akin to that of an
  adverb,&mdash;<i>I fight with bravery</i> = <i>I fight bravely</i>: <i>he
  walks a king</i> = <i>he walks regally</i>. The modal (or adverbial)
  construction, sometimes takes the appearance of the objective: inasmuch
  as intransitive verbs are <!-- Page 337 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page337"></a>[337]</span>frequently followed by a substantive,
  <i>e.g.</i>, <i>to sleep the sleep of the righteous</i>. Here,
  nevertheless, this is no proof of government. For a verb to be capable of
  governing an objective case, it must be a verb signifying an action
  affecting an object; which is not the case here. The sentence means, to
  <i>sleep as the righteous sleep</i>, or <i>according to the sleep of the
  righteous</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE PARTICIPLES.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect481">§ 481</a>. The present participle, or the participle
  in <i>-ing</i>, must be considered in respect to its relations with the
  substantive in <i>-ing</i>. <i>Dying-day</i> is, probably, no more a
  participle than <i>morning-walk</i>. In respect to the syntax of such
  expressions as the forthcoming, I consider that they are <i>either</i>
  participles or substantives.</p>

  <p>1. When substantives, they are in regimen, and govern a genitive
  case&mdash;<i>What is the meaning of the lady's holding up her train?</i>
  Here the word <i>holding</i> = <i>the act of holding</i>.&mdash;<i>Quid
  est significatio elevationis pallæ de parte f&oelig;minæ.</i></p>

  <p>2. When participles, they are in apposition or concord, and would, if
  inflected, appear in the same case with the substantive, or pronoun,
  preceding them&mdash;<i>What is the meaning of the lady holding up her
  train?</i> Here the word <i>holding</i> = <i>in the act of holding</i>,
  and answers to the Latin <i>f&oelig;minæ elevantis</i>.&mdash;<i>Quid est
  significatio f&oelig;minæ elevantis pallam?</i></p>

  <p><a name="sect482">§ 482</a>. The past participle corresponds not with
  the Greek form <span title="tuptomenos" class="grk"
  >&tau;&upsilon;&pi;&tau;&#x1F79;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  but with the form <span title="tetummenos" class="grk"
  >&tau;&epsilon;&tau;&upsilon;&mu;&mu;&#x1F73;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>.
  <i>I am beaten</i> is essentially a combination, expressive not of
  present but of past time, just like the Latin <i>sum verberatus</i>. Its
  Greek equivalent is not <span title="eimi tuptomenos" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&#x1F30;&mu;&#x1F76;
  &tau;&upsilon;&pi;&tau;&#x1F79;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  = <i>I am a man in the act of being beaten</i>, but <span title="eimi tetummenos" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&#x1F30;&mu;&#x1F76;
  &tau;&epsilon;&tau;&upsilon;&mu;&mu;&#x1F73;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  <!-- Page 339 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page339"></a>[339]</span>= <i>I am a man who has been beaten</i>.
  It is past in respect to the action, though present in respect to the
  state brought about by the action. This essentially past element in the
  so-called present expression, <i>I am beaten</i>, will be again referred
  to.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE MOODS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect483">§ 483</a>. The infinitive mood is a noun. The
  current rule that <i>when two verbs come together the latter is placed in
  the infinitive mood</i>, means that one verb can govern another only by
  converting it into a noun&mdash;<i>I begin to move</i> = <i>I begin the
  act of moving</i>. Verbs, <i>as verbs</i>, can only come together in the
  way of apposition&mdash;<i>I irritate</i>, <i>I beat</i>, <i>I talk at
  him</i>, <i>I call him names</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><a name="sect484">§ 484</a>. The construction, however, of English
  infinitives is two fold. (1.) Objective. (2.) Gerundial.</p>

  <p>When one verb is followed by another without the preposition
  <i>to</i>, the construction must be considered to have grown out of the
  objective case, or from the form in <i>-an</i>.</p>

  <p>Such is the case with the following words, and, probably, with
  others:</p>

  <p>This, in the present English, is the rarer of the two
  constructions.</p>

  <p>When a verb is followed by another, preceded by the preposition
  <i>to</i>, the construction must be considered to have grown out of the
  so-called gerund, <i>i.e.</i>, the form in <i>-nne</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the
  dative case&mdash;<i>I begin to move</i>. This is the case with the great
  majority of English verbs.</p>

  <p><a name="sect485">§ 485</a>. <i>Imperatives</i> have three
  peculiarities. (1.) They can only, in English, be used in the second
  person&mdash;<i>go thou on</i>, <i>get you gone</i>, &amp;c.: (2.) They
  take pronouns after, instead of before them: (3.) They often omit the
  pronoun altogether.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE TENSES.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect486">§ 486</a>. Notwithstanding its name, the present
  tense in English does not express a strictly <i>present</i> action. It
  rather expresses an habitual one. <i>He speaks well</i> = <i>he is a good
  speaker</i>. If a man means to say that he is in the act of speaking, he
  says <i>I am speaking</i>.</p>

  <p>It has also, especially when combined with a subjunctive mood, a
  future power&mdash;<i>I beat you</i> ( = <i>I will beat you</i>) <i>if
  you don't leave off</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect487">§ 487</a>. The English præterite is the equivalent,
  not to the Greek perfect but the Greek aorist. <i>I beat</i> = <span
  title="etupsa" class="grk">&#x1F14;&tau;&upsilon;&psi;&alpha;</span> not
  <span title="tetupha" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F73;&tau;&upsilon;&phi;&alpha;</span>. The true perfect is
  expressed, in English, by the auxiliary <i>have</i> + the past
  participle.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">SYNTAX OF THE PERSONS OF VERBS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect488">§ 488</a>. <i>The concord of persons.</i>&mdash;A
  difficulty that occurs frequently in the Latin language is rare in
  English. In expressions like <i>ego et ille</i> followed by a verb, there
  arises a question as to the person in which that verb should be used. Is
  it to be in the first person in order to agree with <i>ego</i>, or in the
  <i>third</i> in order to agree with <i>ille</i>? For the sake of laying
  down a rule upon these and similar points, the classical grammarians
  arrange the persons (as they do the genders) according to their
  <i>dignity</i>, making the verb (or adjective if it be a question of
  gender) agree with the most <i>worthy</i>. In respect to persons, the
  first is more worthy than the second, and the second more worthy than the
  third. Hence, the Latins said&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Ego</i> et <i>Balbus</i> <i>sustulimus</i> manus.</p>
      <p><i>Tu</i> et <i>Balbus</i> <i>sustulistis</i> manus.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now, in English, the plural form is the same for all three persons.
  Hence we say <i>I and you are friends</i>, <i>you and I are friends</i>,
  <i>I and he are friends</i>, &amp;c., so that for the practice of
  language, the question as to the relative dignity of the three persons is
  a matter of indifference.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it <i>may</i> occur even in English. Whenever two or
  more pronouns of different persons, and of the <i>singular</i> number,
  follow each other <i>disjunctively</i>, the question of concord arises.
  <i>I or you</i>,&mdash;<i>you or <!-- Page 344 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page344"></a>[344]</span>he</i>,&mdash;<i>he or
  I</i>. I believe that, in these cases, the rule is as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Whenever the words <i>either</i> or <i>neither</i> precede the
  pronouns, the verb is in the third person. <i>Either you or I is in the
  wrong</i>; <i>neither you nor I is in the wrong</i>.</p>

  <p>2. Whenever the disjunctive is simple (<i>i.e.</i> unaccompanied with
  the word <i>either</i> or <i>neither</i>) the verb agrees with the
  <i>first</i> of the two pronouns.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>I</i> (or <i>he</i>) <i>am</i> in the wrong.</p>
      <p><i>He</i> (or <i>I</i>) <i>is</i> in the wrong.</p>
      <p><i>Thou</i> (or <i>he</i>) <i>art</i> in the wrong.</p>
      <p><i>He</i> (or <i>thou</i>) <i>is</i> in the wrong.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now, provided that they are correct, it is clear that the English
  language knows nothing about the relative degrees of dignity between
  these three pronouns; since its habit is to make the verb agree with the
  one which is placed first&mdash;whatever may be the person. I am strongly
  inclined to believe that the same is the case in Latin; in which case (in
  the sentence <i>ego et Balbus sustulimus manus</i>) <i>sustulimus</i>
  agrees, in person, with <i>ego</i>, not because the first person is the
  worthiest, but because it comes first in the proposition,</p>

  <p><a name="sect489">§ 489</a>. In the Chapter on the Impersonal Verbs,
  it is stated that the construction of <i>me-thinks</i> is peculiar.</p>

  <p>This is because in Anglo-Saxon the word <i>þincan</i> = <i>seem</i>.
  Hence <i>me-thinks</i> is <span title="phainetai moi" class="grk"
  >&phi;&alpha;&#x1F77;&nu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&#x1F77;
  &mu;&omicron;&iota;</span>, or <i>mihi videtur</i>, and <i>me</i> is a
  <i>dative</i> case, not an <i>accusative</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>þencan</i> = <i>think</i>, was, in Anglo-Saxon, a different
  word.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE VOICES OF VERBS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect490">§ 490</a>. In English there is neither a passive nor
  a middle voice.</p>

  <p>The following couplet from Dryden's "Mac Flecnoe" exhibits a
  construction which requires explanation:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>An ancient fabric, raised to inform the sight,</p>
      <p>There stood of yore, and Barbican <i>it hight</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here the word <i>hight</i> = <i>was called</i>, and seems to present
  an instance of the participle being used in a passive sense without the
  so-called verb substantive. Yet it does no such thing. The word is no
  participle at all; but a simple preterite. Certain verbs are
  <i>naturally</i> either passive or active, as one of two allied meanings
  may predominate. <i>To be called</i> is passive; so is, <i>to be
  beaten</i>. But, <i>to bear as a name</i> is active; so is, <i>to take a
  beating</i>. The word, <i>hight</i>, is of the same class of verbs with
  the Latin <i>vapulo</i>; and it is the same as the Latin word,
  <i>cluo</i>.&mdash;<i>Barbican cluit</i> = <i>Barbican audivit</i> =
  <i>Barbican it hight</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE AUXILIARY VERBS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect491">§ 491</a>. The auxiliary verbs, in English, play a
  most important part in the syntax of the language. They may be classified
  upon a variety of principles. The following, however, are all that need
  here be applied.</p>

  <p>A. <i>Classification of auxiliaries according to their inflection or
  non-inflectional powers.</i>&mdash;Inflectional auxiliaries are those
  that may either replace or be replaced by an inflection. Thus&mdash;<i>I
  am struck</i> = the Latin <i>ferior</i>, and the Greek <span
  title="tuptomai" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F7B;&pi;&tau;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&iota;</span>. These
  auxiliaries are in the same relation to verbs that prepositions are to
  nouns. The inflectional auxiliaries are,&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. <i>Have</i>; equivalent to an inflection in the way of
  tense&mdash;<i>I have bitten</i> = <i>mo-mordi</i>.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Shall</i>; ditto. <i>I shall call</i> = <i>voc-abo</i>.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Will</i>; ditto. <i>I will call</i> = <i>voc-abo</i>.</p>

  <p>4. <i>May</i>; equivalent to an inflection in the way of mood. <i>I am
  come that I may see</i> = <i>venio ut vid-eam</i>.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Be</i>; equivalent to an inflection in the way of voice. <i>To
  be beaten</i> = <i>verberari</i>, <span title="tuptesthai" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F7B;&pi;&tau;&epsilon;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;</span>.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Am</i>, <i>art</i>, <i>is</i>, <i>are</i>; ditto. Also
  equivalent to an inflection in the way of tense. <i>I am moving</i> =
  <i>move-o</i>.</p>

  <p>7. <i>Was</i>, <i>were</i>; ditto, ditto. <i>I was beaten</i> = <span
  title="e-tuphthên" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;-&tau;&#x1F7B;&phi;&theta;&eta;&nu;</span>. <i>I was moving</i>
  = <i>move-bam</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Do</i>, <i>can</i>, <i>must</i>, and <i>let</i>, are
  non-inflectional auxiliaries.</p>

  <p>B. <i>Classification of auxiliaries according to their <!-- Page 347
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page347"></a>[347]</span>non-auxiliary
  significations.</i>&mdash;The power of the word <i>have</i> in the
  combination of <i>I have a horse</i> is clear enough. It means
  possession. The power of the same word in the combination <i>I have
  been</i> is not so clear; nevertheless it is a power which has grown out
  of the idea of possession. This shows that the power of a verb as an
  auxiliary may be a modification of its original power; <i>i.e.</i>, of
  the power it has in non-auxiliary constructions. Sometimes the difference
  is very little: the word <i>let</i>, in <i>let us go</i>, has its natural
  sense of permission unimpaired. Sometimes it is lost altogether.
  <i>Can</i> and <i>may</i> exist only as auxiliaries.</p>

  <p>1. Auxiliary derived from the idea of
  possession&mdash;<i>have</i>.</p>

  <p>2. Auxiliaries derived from the idea of existence&mdash;<i>be</i>,
  <i>is</i>, <i>was</i>.</p>

  <p>3. Auxiliary derived from the idea of future destination, dependent
  upon circumstances external to the agent&mdash;<i>shall</i>. There are
  etymological reasons for believing that <i>shall</i> is no present tense,
  but a perfect.</p>

  <p>4. Auxiliary derived from the idea of future destination, dependent
  upon the volition of the agent&mdash;<i>will</i>. <i>Shall</i> is simply
  predictive; <i>will</i> is predictive and promissive as well.</p>

  <p>5. Auxiliary derived from the idea of power, dependent upon
  circumstances external to the agent&mdash;<i>may</i>.</p>

  <p>6. Auxiliary derived from the idea of power, dependent upon
  circumstances internal to the agent&mdash;<i>can</i>. <i>May</i> is
  simply permissive; <i>can</i> is potential. In respect to the idea of
  power residing in the agent being the cause which determines a contingent
  action, <i>can</i> is in the same relation to <i>may</i> as <i>will</i>
  is to <i>shall</i>.</p>

  class="sc">Wallis</span>, 107.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>9. Auxiliary derived from the idea of action&mdash;<i>do</i>.</p>

  <p>C. <i>Classification of auxiliary verbs in respect to their mode of
  construction.</i>&mdash;Auxiliary verbs combine with others in three
  ways.</p>

  <p>1. <i>With participles.</i>&mdash;<i>a</i>) With the present, or
  active, participle&mdash;<i>I am speaking</i>: <i>b</i>) With the past,
  or passive, participle&mdash;<i>I am beaten</i>, <i>I have
  beaten</i>.</p>

  <p>2. <i>With infinitives.</i>&mdash;<i>a</i>) With the objective
  infinitive&mdash;<i>I can speak</i>: <i>b</i>) With the gerundial
  infinitive&mdash;<i>I have to speak</i>.</p>

  <p>3. <i>With both infinitives and participles.</i>&mdash;<i>I shall have
  done</i>, <i>I mean to have done</i>.</p>

  <p>D. <i>Auxiliary verbs may be classified according to their
  effect.</i>&mdash;Thus&mdash;<i>have</i> makes the combination in which
  it appears equivalent to a tense; <i>be</i> to a passive form; <i>may</i>
  to a sign of mood, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>This sketch of the different lights under which auxiliary verbs may be
  viewed, has been written for the sake of illustrating, rather than
  exhausting, the subject.</p>

  <p><a name="sect492">§ 492</a>. The combination of the auxiliary,
  <i>have</i>, with the past participle requires notice. It is, here,
  advisable to make the following classifications.</p>

  <p>1. The combination with the participle of a <i>transitive <!-- Page
  349 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page349"></a>[349]</span>verb.</i>&mdash;<i>I have ridden the
  horse</i>; <i>thou hast broken the sword</i>; <i>he has smitten the
  enemy</i>.</p>

  <p>2. The combination with the participle of an <i>intransitive</i>
  verb,&mdash;<i>I have waited</i>; <i>thou hast hungered</i>; <i>he has
  slept</i>.</p>

  <p>3. The combination with the participle of the verb substantive, <i>I
  have been</i>; <i>thou hast been</i>; <i>he has been</i>.</p>

  <p>It is by examples of the first of these three divisions that the true
  construction is to be shown.</p>

  <p>For an object of any sort to be in the possession of a person, it must
  previously have existed. If I possess a horse, that horse must have had a
  previous existence.</p>

  <p>Hence, in all expressions like <i>I have ridden a horse</i>, there are
  two ideas, a past idea in the participle, and a present idea in the word
  denoting possession.</p>

  <p>For an object of any sort, affected in a particular manner, to be in
  the possession of a person, it must previously have been affected in the
  manner required. If I possess a horse that has been ridden, the riding
  must have taken place before I mention the fact of the ridden horse being
  in my possession; inasmuch as I speak of it as a thing already
  done,&mdash;the participle, <i>ridden</i>, being in the past tense.</p>

  <p><i>I have ridden a horse</i> = <i>I have a horse ridden</i> = <i>I
  have a horse as a ridden horse</i>, or (changing the gender and dealing
  with the word <i>horse</i> as a thing) <i>I have a horse as a ridden
  thing</i>.</p>

  <p>In this case the syntax is of the usual sort. (1) <i>Have</i> =
  <i>own</i> = <i>habeo</i> = <i>teneo</i>; (2) <i>horse</i> is the
  accusative case <i>equum</i>; (3) <i>ridden</i> is a past participle
  agreeing either with <i>horse</i>, or <i>with a word in apposition with
  it understood</i>.</p>

  <p>Mark the words in italics. The word <i>ridden</i> does not agree with
  <i>horse</i>, since it is of the neuter gender. <!-- Page 350 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page350"></a>[350]</span>Neither if we said <i>I
  have ridden the horses</i>, would it agree with <i>horses</i>; since it
  is of the singular number.</p>

  <p>The true construction is arrived at by supplying the word
  <i>thing</i>. <i>I have a horse as a ridden thing</i> = <i>habeo equum
  equitatum</i> (neuter). Here the construction is the same as <i>triste
  lupus stabulis</i>.</p>

  <p><i>I have horses as a ridden thing</i> = <i>habeo equos equitatum</i>
  (singular, neuter). Here the construction is&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Triste ... maturis frugibus imbres,</p>
      <p>Arboribus venti, nobis Amaryllidos iræ."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>or in Greek&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span title="Deinon gunaixin hai di' ôdinôn gonai" class="grk">&Delta;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;&#x1F78;&nu; &gamma;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&iota;&xi;&#x1F76;&nu; &alpha;&#x1F31; &delta;&iota;' &#x1F60;&delta;&#x1F77;&nu;&omega;&nu; &gamma;&omicron;&nu;&alpha;&#x1F77;</span>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The classical writers supply instances of this use of <i>have</i>.
  <i>Compertum habeo</i>, milites, verba viris virtutem non addere = <i>I
  have discovered</i> = <i>I am in possession of the discovery</i>. Quæ cum
  ita sint, satis de Cæsare hoc <i>dictum habeo</i>.</p>

  <p>The combination of <i>have</i> with an intransitive verb is
  irreducible to the idea of possession: indeed, it is illogical. In <i>I
  have waited</i>, we cannot make the idea expressed by the word
  <i>waited</i> the object of the verb <i>have</i> or <i>possess</i>. The
  expression has become a part of language by means of the extension of a
  false analogy. It is an instance of an illegitimate imitation.</p>

  <p>The combination of <i>have</i> with <i>been</i> is more illogical
  still, and is a stronger instance of the influence of an illegitimate
  imitation. In German and Italian, where even <i>intransitive</i> verbs
  are combined with the equivalents to the English <i>have</i>
  (<i>haben</i>, and <i>avere</i>), the verb substantive is not so
  combined; on the contrary, the combinations are</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Italian; <i>io sono stato</i> = <i>I am been</i>.</p>
      <p>German; <i>ich bin gewesen</i> = <i>ditto</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>which is logical. <!-- Page 351 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page351"></a>[351]</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect493">§ 493</a>. <i>I am to speak</i>.&mdash;Three facts
  explain this idiom.</p>

  <p>1. The idea of <i>direction towards an object</i> conveyed by the
  dative case, and by combinations equivalent to it.</p>

  <p>2. The extent to which the ideas of necessity, obligation, or
  intention are connected with the idea of <i>something that has to be
  done</i>, or <i>something towards which some action has a
  tendency</i>.</p>

  <p>3. The fact that expressions like the one in question historically
  represent an original dative case, or its equivalent; since <i>to
  speak</i> grows out of the Anglo-Saxon form <i>to sprecanne</i>, which,
  although called a gerund, is really a dative case of the infinitive
  mood.</p>

  <p>When Johnson thought that, in the phrase <i>he is to blame</i>, the
  word <i>blame</i> was a noun, if he meant a noun in the way that
  <i>culpa</i> is a noun, his view was wrong. But if he meant a noun in the
  way that <i>culpare</i>, <i>ad culpandum</i>, are nouns, it was
  right.</p>

  <p><a name="sect494">§ 494</a>. <i>I am to blame</i>.&mdash;This idiom is
  one degree more complex than the previous one; since <i>I am to blame</i>
  = <i>I am to be blamed</i>. As early, however, as the Anglo-Saxon period
  the gerunds were liable to be used in a passive sense: <i>he is to
  lufigenne</i> = not <i>he is to love</i>, but <i>he is to be
  loved</i>.</p>

  <p>The principle of this confusion may be discovered by considering that
  <i>an object to be blamed</i>, is <i>an object for some one to blame</i>,
  <i>an object to be loved</i> is <i>an object for some one to
  love</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect495">§ 495</a>. <i>I am beaten</i>.&mdash;This is a
  present combination, and it is present on the strength of the verb
  <i>am</i>, not on the strength of the participle <i>beaten</i>, which is
  præterite.</p>

  <p><a name="sect496">§ 496</a>. The syntax of the adverb is simpler than
  that of any other part of speech, excepting, perhaps, that of the
  adjective.</p>

  <p>Adverbs have no concord.</p>

  <p>Neither have they any government. They <i>seem</i>, indeed, to have
  it, when they are in the comparative or superlative degree; but it is
  merely apparent. In <i>this is better than that</i>, the word <i>that</i>
  is governed neither by <i>better</i> nor by <i>than</i>. It is not
  governed at all. It is a nominative case; the subject of a separate
  proposition. <i>This is better (i.e., more good) than that is good.</i>
  Even if we admit such an expression as <i>he is stronger than me</i> to
  be good English, there is no adverbial government. <i>Than</i>, if it
  govern <i>me</i> at all, governs it as a preposition.</p>

  <p>The position of an adverb is, in respect to matters of syntax,
  pre-eminently parenthetic; <i>i.e.</i>, it may be omitted without
  injuring the construction. <i>He is fighting&mdash;now; he was
  fighting&mdash;then; he fights&mdash;bravely; I am
  almost&mdash;tired</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><a name="sect497">§ 497</a>. By referring to the Chapter on the
  Adverbs, we shall find that the neuter adjective is frequently converted
  into an adverb by deflection. As any neuter adjective may be so
  deflected, we may justify such expressions as <i>full</i> (for
  <i>fully</i>) as <i>conspicuous</i> (for <!-- Page 354 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page354"></a>[354]</span><i>conspicuously</i>),
  and <i>peculiar</i> (for <i>peculiarly</i>) <i>bad grace</i>, &amp;c. We
  are not, however, bound to imitate everything that we can justify.</p>

  <p><a name="sect498">§ 498</a>. The termination <i>-ly</i> was originally
  adjectival. At present it is a derivational syllable by which we can
  convert an adjective into an adverb: <i>brave, brave-ly</i>. When,
  however, the adjective ends in <i>-ly</i> already, the formation is
  awkward. <i>I eat my daily bread</i> is unexceptionable English; <i>I eat
  my bread daily</i> is exceptionable. One of two things must here take
  place: the two syllables <i>ly</i> are packed into one (the full
  expression being <i>dai-li-ly</i>), or else the construction is that of a
  neuter adjective deflected.</p>

  <p>Adverbs are convertible. <i>The then men</i> = <span title="hoi nun brotoi" class="grk"
  >&omicron;&#x1F31; &nu;&#x1FE6;&nu;
  &beta;&rho;&#x1F79;&tau;&omicron;&iota;</span>, &amp;c. This will be seen
  more clearly in the Chapter on Conjunctions.</p>

  <p><a name="sect499">§ 499</a>. It has been remarked that in expressions
  like <i>he sleeps the sleep of the righteous</i>, the construction is
  adverbial. So it is in expressions like <i>he walked a mile, it weighs a
  pound</i>. The ideas expressed by <i>mile</i> and <i>pound</i> are not
  the names of anything that serves as either object or instrument to the
  verb. They only denote the <i>manner</i> of the action, and define the
  meaning of the verb.</p>

  <p><a name="sect500">§ 500</a>. <i>From whence</i>, <i>from
  thence</i>.&mdash;This is an expression which, if it have not taken root
  in our language, is likely to do so. It is an instance of excess of
  expression in the way of syntax; the <i>-ce</i> denoting direction
  <i>from</i> a place, and the preposition doing the same. It is not so
  important to determine what this construction <i>is</i>, as to suggest
  what it is <i>not</i>. It is <i>not</i> an instance of an adverb governed
  by a preposition. If the two words be dealt with as logically separate,
  <i>whence</i> (or <i>thence</i>) must be a noun = <i>which place</i> (or
  <i>that <!-- Page 355 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page355"></a>[355]</span>place</i>); just as <i>from then till
  now</i> = <i>from that time to this</i>. But if (which is the better
  view) the two words be dealt with as one (<i>i.e.</i>, as an improper
  compound) the preposition <i>from</i> has lost its natural power, and
  become the element of an adverb.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON PREPOSITIONS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect501">§ 501</a>. All prepositions govern an oblique case.
  If a word ceases to do this, it ceases to be a preposition. In the first
  of the two following sentences the word <i>up</i> is a preposition, in
  the second an adverb.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. <i>I climbed up the tree.</i></p>
      <p>2. <i>I climbed up.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>All prepositions in English, precede the noun which they govern. <i>I
  climbed up the tree</i>, never <i>I climbed the tree up</i>. This is a
  matter not of government, but of collocation. It is the case in most
  languages; and, from the frequency of its occurrence, the term
  <i>pre-position</i> (or <i>pre-fix</i>) has originated. Nevertheless, it
  is by no means a philological necessity. In many languages the
  prepositions are<i> post-positive</i>, following their noun.</p>

  <p><a name="sect502">§ 502</a>. No preposition, in the present English,
  governs a genitive case. This remark is made, because expressions like
  the <i>part of the body = pars corporis,&mdash;a piece of the bread =
  portio panis</i>, make it appear as if the preposition <i>of</i> did so.
  The true expression is, that the preposition <i>of</i> followed by an
  objective case is equivalent in many instances, to the genitive case of
  the classical languages.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON CONJUNCTIONS.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect503">§ 503</a>. A conjunction is a part of speech which
  connects <i>propositions</i>,&mdash;<i>the day is bright</i>, is one
  proposition. <i>The sun shines</i>, is another. <i>The day is bright</i>
  because <i>the sun shines</i> is a pair of propositions connected by the
  conjunction, <i>because</i>.</p>

  <p>From this it follows, that whenever there is a conjunction, there are
  two subjects, two copulas, and two predicates: <i>i.e.</i>, two
  propositions in all their parts.</p>

  <p>But this may be expressed compendiously. <i>The sun shines, and the
  moon shines</i> may be expressed by the <i>sun and moon shine</i>.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, however compendious may be the expression, there are
  always two propositions wherever there is one conjunction. A part of
  speech that merely combines two words is a preposition,&mdash;<i>the sun
  along with the moon shines</i>.</p>

  <p>It is highly important to remember that conjunctions connect
  propositions.</p>

  <p>It is also highly important to remember that many double propositions
  may be expressed so compendiously as to look like one. When this takes
  place, and any question arises as to the construction, they must be
  exhibited in their fully expanded form, <i>i.e.</i>, the second subject,
  the second predicate, and the second copula must be supplied. This can
  always be done from the first <!-- Page 358 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page358"></a>[358]</span>proposition,&mdash;<i>he likes you better
  than me</i> = <i>he likes you better than he likes me</i>. The
  compendious expression of the second proposition is the first point of
  note in the syntax of conjunctions.</p>

  <p><a name="sect504">§ 504</a>. The second point in the syntax of
  conjunctions is the fact of their great convertibility. Most conjunctions
  have been developed out of some other part of speech.</p>

  <p>The conjunction of comparison, <i>than</i>, is derived from the adverb
  of time, <i>then</i>: which is derived from the accusative singular of
  the demonstrative pronoun.</p>

  <p>The conjunction, <i>that</i>, is derived also from a demonstrative
  pronoun.</p>

  <p>The conjunction, <i>therefore</i>, is a demonstrative pronoun + a
  preposition.</p>

  <p>The conjunction, <i>because</i>, is a substantive governed by a
  preposition.</p>

  <p>One and the same word, in one and the same sentence, may be a
  conjunction or preposition, as the case may be.</p>

  <p><i>All fled but John</i>.&mdash;If this mean <i>all fled</i> except
  <i>John</i>, the word <i>but</i> is a preposition, the word <i>John</i>
  is an accusative case, and the proposition is single. If instead of
  <i>John</i>, we had a personal pronoun, we should say <i>all fled but</i>
  him.</p>

  <p><i>All fled but John</i>.&mdash;If this mean <i>all fled but John did
  not fly</i>, the word <i>but</i> is a conjunction, the word <i>John</i>
  is a nominative case, and the propositions are two in number. If, instead
  of <i>John</i>, we had a personal pronoun, we should say, <i>all fled
  but</i> he.</p>

  <p>From the fact of the great convertibility of conjunctions it is often
  necessary to determine whether a word be a conjunction or not. <i>If it
  be a conjunction, it cannot govern a case. If it govern a case it is no
  conjunction <!-- Page 359 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page359"></a>[359]</span>but a preposition.</i> A conjunction
  cannot govern a case, for the following reasons,&mdash;the word that
  follows it <i>must</i> be the subject of the second proposition, and as
  such, a nominative case.</p>

  <p><a name="sect505">§ 505</a>. The third point to determine in the
  syntax of conjunctions is the certainty or uncertainty in the mind of the
  speaker as to the facts expressed by the propositions which they serve to
  connect.</p>

  <p>1. Each proposition may contain a certain, definite, absolute
  fact&mdash;<i>the day is clear</i> because <i>the sun shines</i>. Here
  there is neither doubt nor contingency of either the <i>day being
  clear</i>, or of the <i>sun shining</i>.</p>

  <p>Of two propositions one may be the condition of the other&mdash;<i>the
  day will be clear</i> if <i>the sun shine</i>. Here, although it is
  certain that <i>if the sun shine the day will be clear</i>, there is no
  certainty of <i>the sun shining</i>. Of the two propositions one only
  embodies a certain fact, and that is certain only conditionally.</p>

  <p>Now an action, wherein there enters any notion of uncertainty, or
  indefinitude, and is at the same time connected with another action, is
  expressed, not by the indicative mood, but by the subjunctive. <i>If the
  sun</i> shine (not <i>shines</i>) <i>the day will be clear.</i></p>

  <p>Simple uncertainty will not constitute a subjunctive
  construction,&mdash;<i>I am</i>, perhaps, <i>in the wrong</i>.</p>

  <p>Neither will simple connection.&mdash;<i>I am wrong</i>, because
  <i>you are right</i>.</p>

  <p>But, the two combined constitute the construction in
  question,&mdash;<i>if I </i>be<i> wrong, you are right</i>.</p>

  <p>Now, a conjunction that connects two certain propositions may be said
  to govern an indicative mood.</p>

  <p>And a conjunction that connects an uncertain proposition with a
  certain one, may be said to govern a subjunctive mood. <!-- Page 360
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page360"></a>[360]</span></p>

  <p><i>The government of mood is the only form of government of which
  conjunctions are capable.</i></p>

  <p><a name="sect506">§ 506</a>. Previous to the question of the
  government of conjunctions in the way of mood, it is necessary to notice
  certain points of agreement between them and the relative pronouns;
  inasmuch as, in many cases, the relative pronoun exerts the same
  government, in the way of determining the mood of the verb, as the
  conjunction.</p>

  <p>Between the relative pronouns and conjunctions in general there is
  this point of connection,&mdash;both join propositions. Wherever there is
  a relative, there is a second proposition. So there is wherever there is
  a conjunction.</p>

  <p>Between certain relative pronouns and those particular conjunctions
  that govern a subjunctive mood there is also a point of connection. Both
  suggest an element of uncertainty or indefinitude. This the relative
  pronouns do, through the logical elements common to them and to the
  interrogatives: these latter essentially suggesting the idea of doubt.
  Wherever the person, or thing, connected with an action, and expressed by
  a relative is indefinite, there is room for the use of a subjunctive
  mood. Thus&mdash;"he that troubled you shall bear his judgment,
  <i>whosoever</i> he <i>be</i>."</p>

  <p><a name="sect507">§ 507</a>. By considering the nature of such words
  as <i>when</i>, their origin as relatives on the one hand, and their
  conjunctional character on the other hand, we are prepared for finding a
  relative element in words like <i>till</i>, <i>until</i>, <i>before</i>,
  <i>as long as</i>, &amp;c. These can all be expanded into expressions
  like <i>until the time when</i>, <i>during the time when</i>, &amp;c.
  Hence, in an expression like <i>seek out his wickedness till thou</i>
  find (not <i>findest</i>) <i>none</i>, the principle <!-- Page 361
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page361"></a>[361]</span>of the
  construction is nearly the same as in <i>he that troubled you</i>,
  &amp;c., or <i>vice versâ</i>.<a name="footnotetag64"
  href="#footnote64"><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

  <p><a name="sect508">§ 508</a>. In most conditional expressions the
  subjunctive mood should follow the conjunction. All the following
  expressions are conditional.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. <i>Except</i> I <i>be</i> by Silvia in the night,</p>
      <p class="i2">There is no music in the nightingale.&mdash;<span class="sc">Shakspeare.</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <i>fall</i> upon <span class="correction" title="Omitted in original."

</blockquote>

  Testament.</i></p>

  <p>6. He shall not eat of the holy thing <i>unless</i> he <i>wash</i> his
  flesh with water.&mdash;<i>Old Testament.</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Expressions like <i>except</i> and <i>unless</i> are equally
  conditional with words like <i>if</i> and <i>provided that</i>, since
  they are equivalent to <i>if&mdash;not</i>.</p>

  <p>Expressions like <i>though</i> and <i>although</i> are peculiar. They
  join propositions, of which the one is a <i>primâ facie</i> reason
  against the existence of the other: and this is the conditional element.
  In the sentence, <i>if the children be so badly brought-up, they are not
  to be trusted</i>, the <i>bad bringing-up</i> is the reason for their
  being <i>unfit to be trusted</i>; and, as far as the expression is
  concerned, <i>is admitted to be so</i>. The only uncertainty lies in the
  question as to the degree of the badness of the education. The inference
  from it is unequivocal.</p>

<p><!-- Page 362 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page362"></a>[362]</span></p>

  <p>But if, instead of saying <i>if</i>, we say <i>although</i>, and omit
  the word <i>not</i>, so that the sentence run <i>although the children be
  so badly brought-up they are to be trusted</i>, we do two things: we
  indicate the general relation of cause and effect that exists between
  <i>bad bringing-up</i> and <i>unfitness for being trusted</i>, but we
  also, at the same time, take an exception to it in the particular
  instance before us. These remarks have been made for the sake of showing
  the extent to which words like <i>though</i>, &amp;c., are
  conditional.</p>

  <p>It must be remembered, however, that conjunctions, like the ones
  lately quoted, do not govern subjunctive moods because they are
  conditional, but because, in the particular condition which they
  accompany, there is an element of uncertainty.</p>

  <p><a name="sect509">§ 509</a>. This introduces a fresh question.
  Conditional conjunctions are of two sorts:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Those which express a condition as an actual fact, and one admitted
  as such by the speaker.</p>

  <p>2. Those which express a condition as a possible fact, and one which
  the speaker either does not admit, or admits only in a qualified
  manner.</p>

  <p>Since <i>the children</i> are <i>so badly brought-up</i>,
  &amp;c.&mdash;This is an instance of the first construction. The speaker
  admits as an actual fact the <i>bad bringing-up of the children</i>.</p>

  <p>If <i>the children</i> be <i>so badly brought-up</i>,
  &amp;c.&mdash;This is an instance of the second construction. The speaker
  admits as a possible (perhaps, as a probable) fact the <i>bad bringing-up
  of the children</i>: but he does not adopt it as an indubitable one.</p>

  <p><a name="sect510">§ 510</a>. Now, if every conjunction had a fixed
  unvariable meaning, there would be no difficulty in determining whether a
  condition was absolute, and beyond doubt, or <!-- Page 363 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page363"></a>[363]</span>possible, and liable to
  doubt. But such is not the case.</p>

  <p><i>Although</i> may precede a proposition which is admitted as well as
  one which is doubted.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>a.</i> Although <i>the children</i> are, &amp;c.</p>
      <p><i>b.</i> Although <i>the children</i> be, &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>If</i>, too, may precede propositions wherein there is no doubt
  whatever implied: in other words it may be used instead of
  <i>since</i>.</p>

  <p>In some languages this interchange goes farther than in others; in the
  Greek, for instance, such is the case with <span title="ei" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&#x1F30;</span>, to a very great extent indeed.</p>

  <p>Hence we must look to the meaning of the sentence in general, rather
  than to the particular conjunction used.</p>

  <p>It is a philological fact that <i>if</i> may stand instead of
  <i>since</i>.</p>

  <p>It is also a philological fact that when it does so it should be
  followed by the indicative mood.</p>

  <p>This is written in the way of illustration. What applies to <i>if</i>
  applies to other conjunctions as well.</p>

  <p><a name="sect511">§ 511</a>. As a point of practice, the following
  method of determining the amount of doubt expressed in a conditional
  proposition is useful:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Insert, immediately after the conjunction, one of the two following
  phrases,&mdash;(1.) <i>as is the case</i>; (2.) <i>as may or may not be
  the case</i>. By ascertaining which of these two supplements expresses
  the meaning of the speaker, we ascertain the mood of the verb which
  follows.</p>

  <p>When the first formula is the one required, there is no element of
  doubt, and the verb should be in the indicative mood. <i>If</i> (<i>as is
  the case</i>), <i>he </i>is<i> gone, I must follow him</i>. <!-- Page 364
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page364"></a>[364]</span></p>

  <p>When the second formula is the one required, there <i>is</i> an
  element of doubt, and the verb should be in the subjunctive mood.
  <i>If</i> (<i>as may or may not be the case</i>) <i>he </i>be<i> gone, I
  must follow him</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect512">§ 512</a>. The use of the word <i>that</i> in
  expressions like <i>I eat that I may live</i>, &amp;c., is a modification
  of the subjunctive construction, that is conveniently called
  <i>potential</i>. It denotes that one act is done for the sake of
  supplying the <i>power</i> or opportunity for the performance of
  another.</p>

  <p>The most important point connected with the powers of <i>that</i> is
  the so-called <i>succession of tenses</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect513">§ 513</a>. <i>The succession of
  tenses.</i>&mdash;Whenever the conjunction <i>that</i> expresses
  intention, and consequently connects two verbs, the second of which takes
  place <i>after</i> the first, the verbs in question must be in the same
  tense.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I <i>do</i> this <i>that</i> I <i>may</i> gain by it</p>
      <p>I <i>did</i> this <i>that</i> I <i>might</i> gain by it.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the Greek language this is expressed by a difference of mood; the
  subjunctive being the construction equivalent to <i>may</i>, the optative
  to <i>might</i>. The Latin idiom coincides with the English.</p>

  <p>A little consideration will show that this rule is absolute. For a man
  <i>to be doing</i> one action (in present time) in order that some other
  action may <i>follow</i> it (in past time) is to reverse the order of
  cause and effect. To do anything in <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1851,
  that something may result from it in 1850 is a contradiction; and so it
  is to say <i>I </i>do<i> this</i> that <i>I </i>might<i> gain by
  it</i>.</p>

  <p>The reasons against the converse construction are nearly, if not
  equally cogent. To have done anything at any <i>previous</i> time in
  order that a <i>present</i> effect may follow, is, <i>ipso facto</i>, to
  convert a past act into a present one, or, to speak in the language of
  the grammarian, to convert <!-- Page 365 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page365"></a>[365]</span>an aorist into a perfect. To say <i>I
  </i>did<i> this</i> that <i>I may gain by it</i>, is to make, by the very
  effect of the expression, either <i>may</i> equivalent to <i>might</i>,
  or <i>did</i> equivalent to <i>have done</i>.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>I </i>did<i> this</i> that <i>I </i>might<i> gain</i>.</p>
      <p><i>I </i>have done<i> this</i> that <i>I </i>may<i> gain</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><a name="sect514">§ 514</a>. <i>Disjunctives.</i>&mdash;Disjunctives
  (<i>or</i>, <i>nor</i>) are of two sorts, real and nominal.</p>

  <p><i>A king or queen always rules in England</i>. Here the disjunction
  is real; <i>king</i> or <i>queen</i> being different names for different
  objects. In all <i>real</i> disjunctions the inference is, that if one
  out of two (or more) individuals (or classes) do not perform a certain
  action, the other does.</p>

  <p><i>A sovereign or supreme ruler always rules in England</i>. Here the
  disjunction is nominal; <i>sovereign</i> and <i>supreme governor</i>
  being different names for the same object. In all nominal disjunctives
  the inference is, that if an agent (or agents) do not perform a certain
  action under one name, he does (or they do) it under another.</p>

  <p>Nominal disjunctives are called by Harris <i>sub</i>disjunctives.</p>

  <p>In the English language there is no separate word to distinguish the
  nominal from the real disjunctive. In Latin, <i>vel</i> is considered by
  Harris to be disjunctive, <i>sive</i> subdisjunctive. As a periphrasis,
  the combination <i>in other words</i> is subdisjunctive.</p>

  <p>Both nominal and real disjunctives agree in this,&mdash;whatever may
  be the number of nouns which they connect, the construction of the verb
  is the same as if there were but one&mdash;Henry, <i>or</i> John,
  <i>or</i> Thomas, <i>walks</i> (not <i>walk</i>); the sun, <i>or</i>
  solar luminary, <i>shines</i> (not <i>shine</i>). The disjunctive
  <i>isolates</i> the subject, however much it may be placed in
  juxtaposition with other nouns.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">THE SYNTAX OF THE NEGATIVE.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect515">§ 515</a>. When the verb is in the infinitive mood,
  the negative precedes it.&mdash;<i>Not to advance is to retreat</i>.</p>

  <p>When the verb is not in the infinitive mood, the negative follows
  it.&mdash;<i>He advanced not</i>. <i>I cannot</i>.</p>

  <p>This rule is absolute. It only <i>seems</i> to precede the verb in
  such expressions as <i>I do not advance</i>, <i>I cannot advance</i>,
  <i>I have not advanced</i>, &amp;c. However, the words <i>do</i>,
  <i>can</i>, and <i>have</i>, are no infinitives; and it consequently
  follows them. The word <i>advance</i> is an infinitive, and it
  consequently precedes it. Wallis's rule makes an equivalent statement,
  although differently. "Adverbium negandi <i>not</i> (non) verbo
  postponitur (nempe auxiliari primo si adsit; aut si non adsit auxiliare,
  verbo principali): aliis tamen orationis partibus præfigi
  solet."&mdash;P. 113.</p>

  <p>That the negative is rarely used, except with an auxiliary, in other
  words, that the presence of a negative converts a simple form like <i>it
  burneth not</i> into the circumlocution it <i>does not burn</i>, is a
  fact in the practice of the English language. The syntax is the same in
  either expression.</p>

  <p><a name="sect516">§ 516</a>. What may be called the
  <i>distribution</i> of the negative is pretty regular in English. Thus,
  when the word <i>not</i> comes between an indicative, imperative, or
  subjunctive mood and an infinitive verb, it almost <!-- Page 367 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page367"></a>[367]</span>always is taken with
  the word which it <i>follows</i>&mdash;<i>I can not eat</i> may mean
  either <i>I can&mdash;not eat</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>I can abstain</i>), or
  <i>I can not&mdash;eat</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>I am unable to eat</i>); but,
  as stated above, it <i>almost</i> always has the latter
  signification.</p>

  <p>But not <i>always</i>. In Byron's "Deformed Transformed" we find the
  following lines:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Clay! not dead but soulless,</p>
      <p class="i2">Though no mortal man would choose thee,</p>
      <p>An immortal no less</p>
      <p class="i2">Deigns <i>not to refuse</i> thee.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here <i>not to refuse</i> = <i>to accept;</i> and is probably a
  Grecism. <i>To not refuse</i> would, perhaps, be better.</p>

  <p>The next expression is still more foreign to the English
  idiom:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>For <i>not</i> to have been dipped in Lethe's lake</p>
      <p><i>Could save</i> the son of Thetis from to die.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here <i>not</i> is to be taken with <i>could</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect517">§ 517</a>. In the present English, two negatives
  make an affirmative. <i>I have not not seen him</i> = <i>I have seen
  him</i>. In Greek this was not the case. <i>Duæ aut plures negativæ apud
  Græcos vehementius negant</i> is a well known rule. The Anglo-Saxon idiom
  differed from the English and coincided with the Greek. The French
  negative is only apparently double; words like <i>point</i>, <i>pas</i>,
  mean not <i>not</i>, but <i>at all</i>. <i>Je ne parle pas</i> = <i>I not
  speak at all</i>, not <i>I not speak no</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect518">§ 518</a>. <i>Questions of appeal.</i>&mdash;All
  questions imply want of information; want of information may then imply
  doubt; doubt, perplexity; and perplexity the absence of an alternative.
  In this way, what are called, by Mr. Arnold,<a name="footnotetag65"

  practically speaking, <!-- Page 368 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  asked in extreme perplexity, means that nothing can well be done. In the
  following passage we have the presence of a question instead of a
  negative:&mdash;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ON THE CASE ABSOLUTE.</span></p>

  <p><a name="sect519">§ 519</a>. Broadly speaking, all adverbial
  constructions are absolute. The term, however, is conveniently limited to
  a particular combination of the noun, verb, and participle. When two
  actions are connected with each other, either by the fact of their
  simultaneous occurrence, or as cause and effect, they may be expressed
  within the limits of a single proposition, by expressing the one by means
  of a verb, and the other by means of a noun and participle agreeing with
  each other. <i>The door being open, the horse was stolen.</i></p>

  <p>Considering the nature of the connection between the two actions, we
  find good grounds for expecting <i>à priori</i> that the participle will
  be in the instrumental case, when such exists in the language: and when
  not, in some case allied to it, <i>i.e.</i>, the ablative or dative.</p>

  <p>In Latin the ablative is the case that is used absolutely. <i>Sole
  orto, claruit dies.</i></p>

  <p>In Anglo-Saxon the absolute case was the dative. This is logical.</p>

  <p>In the present English, however, the nominative is the absolute case.
  <i>He made the best proverbs, him alone excepted</i>, is an expression of
  Tillotson's. We should now write <i>he alone excepted</i>. The present
  mode of expression <!-- Page 370 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page370"></a>[370]</span>is only to be justified by considering the
  nominative form to be a dative one, just as in the expression <i>you are
  here</i>, the word <i>you</i>, although an accusative, is considered as a
  nominative. A real nominative absolute is as illogical as a real
  accusative case governing a verb.</p>

<h3>PART VI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">PROSODY.</p>

  <p><a name="sect520">§ 520</a>. The word <i>Prosody</i> is derived from a
  Greek word (<i>prosodia</i>) signifying <i>accent</i>. It is used by
  Latin and English grammarians in a wider sense, and includes not only the
  doctrines of accent and quantity, but also the laws of metre and
  versification.</p>

  <p><a name="sect521">§ 521</a>. Observe the accents in the following
  lines:&mdash;</p>

  similarly affected, being similarly accented. Accent is not the only
  quality of a syllable, which by returning at regular intervals can
  constitute metre. It is the one, however, upon which English metre
  depends. English metre essentially consists in the regular recurrence of
  syllables similarly <i>accented</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect524">§ 524</a>. Determine the length of the line in

  either measure by the syllables, and say that the line consists of eight
  syllables; or by the accents, and say that it consists of four accents.
  In this latter case we take the accented syllable with its corresponding
  <!-- Page 373 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page373"></a>[373]</span>unaccented one, and, grouping the two
  together, deal with the pair at once. Now, a group of syllables thus
  taken together is called a <i>measure</i>. In the line in question <i>the

  another, and so on throughout; the line itself consisting of four
  measures.</p>

  <p><a name="sect525">§ 525</a>. <i>Trisyllabic measures.</i>&mdash;The
  number of measures consisting of two syllables, or dissyllabic measures,
  is necessarily limited to two, expressed <i>a x</i> and <i>x a</i>
  respectively. But beyond these there are in the English language measures
  of three syllables, or trisyllabic measures. The number of these is
  necessarily limited to three.</p>

  <p>The first of these is exhibited in the word <i>mérrily</i> (<i>a x

  and verses; and lines and verses, <!-- Page 374 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page374"></a>[374]</span>regularly arranged,
  constitute couplets, triplets, and stanzas, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><a name="sect527">§ 527</a>. The expression of measures, lines,
  &amp;c., by such symbols as <i>a x</i>, <i>x a</i>, &amp;c., is
  <i>metrical notation</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect528">§ 528</a>. <i>Rhyme.</i>&mdash;We can have English
  verse without <i>rhyme</i>. We cannot have English verse without
  <i>accent</i>. Hence accent is an <i>essential</i>; rhyme an
  <i>accessory</i> to metre.</p>

  <p><a name="sect529">§ 529</a>. <i>Analysis of a pair of rhyming
  syllables.</i>&mdash;Let the syllables <i>told</i> and <i>bold</i> be
  taken to pieces, and let the separate parts of each be compared. Viewed
  in reference to metre, they consist of three parts or elements: 1. the
  vowel (<i>o</i>); 2. the part <i>preceding</i> the vowel (<i>t</i> and
  <i>b</i> respectively); 3. the parts <i>following</i> the vowel
  (<i>ld</i>). Now the vowel (<i>o</i>) and the parts following the vowel
  (<i>ld</i>) are alike in both words (<i>old</i>); but the part preceding
  the vowel is different in the different words (<i>told</i>, <i>bold</i>).
  This difference between the parts preceding the vowels is essential;
  since, if it were not for this, the two words would be identical, or
  rather there would be but one word altogether. This is the case with
  <i>I</i> and <i>eye</i>. Sound for sound (although different in spelling)
  the two words are identical, and, consequently, the rhyme is faulty.</p>

  <p>Again&mdash;compared with the words <i>bold</i> and <i>told</i>, the
  words <i>teeth</i> and <i>breeze</i> have two of the elements necessary
  to constitute a rhyme. The vowels are alike (<i>ee</i>), whilst the parts
  preceding the vowels are different (<i>br</i> and <i>t</i>); and, as far
  as these two matters are concerned, the rhyme is a good one, <i>tee</i>
  and <i>bree</i>. Notwithstanding this, there is anything rather than a
  rhyme; since the parts following the vowel (<i>th</i> and <i>ze</i>)
  instead of agreeing, differ. <i>Breathe</i> and <i>beneath</i> are in the
  same <!-- Page 375 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page375"></a>[375]</span>predicament, because the <i>th</i> is not
  sounded alike in the two words.</p>

  <p>Again&mdash;the words <i>feel</i> and <i>mill</i> constitute only a
  false and imperfect rhyme. Sound for sound, the letters <i>f</i> and
  <i>m</i> (the parts preceding the vowel) are different. This is as it
  should be. Also, sound for sound, <i>l</i> and <i>ll</i> (the parts
  following the vowel) are identical; and this is as it should be also: but
  <i>ee</i> and <i>i</i> (the vowels) are different, and this difference
  spoils the rhyme. <i>None</i> and <i>own</i> are in the same predicament;
  since one <i>o</i> is sounded as <i>o</i> in <i>note</i>, and the other
  as the <i>u</i> in <i>but</i>.</p>

  <p>From what has gone before we get the notion of true and perfect rhymes
  as opposed to false and imperfect ones. For two (or more) words to rhyme
  to each other, it is necessary</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>a.</i> That the vowel be the same in both.</p>
      <p><i>b.</i> That the parts following the vowel be the same.</p>
      <p><i>c.</i> That the parts preceding the vowel be different.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Beyond this it is necessary that the syllables, to form a full and
  perfect rhyme, should be accented syllables. <i>Sky</i> and <i>lie</i>
  form good rhymes, but <i>sky</i> and merri<i>ly</i> bad ones, and
  <i>merrily</i> and <i>silly</i> worse. Lines like the second and fourth
  of the following stanza are slightly exceptionable on this score: indeed,
  many readers sacrifice the accent in the word <i>mérrily</i> to the
  rhyme, and pronounce it <i>merrilý</i>.</p>

  are imperfect <!-- Page 376 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page376"></a>[376]</span>rhymes, because <i>h</i> (being no
  articulate sound) counts as nothing, and so the parts before the vowel
  <i>i</i> and <i>a</i> are not different (as they ought to be) but
  identical.</p>

  syllable, and no more. Hence, with five accents, there are to each line
  ten syllables. This is not the case with all verses. Some rhymes are
  double, and the last accented syllable has two unaccented ones to follow
  it. Hence, with five accents there are to each line eleven syllables. Now
  it is in the last measure that this supernumerary unaccented syllable
  appears; and it is a general rule, that, in the last measure of any
  verse, supernumerary unaccented syllables can be admitted without
  destroying the original character of the measure.</p>

  <p><a name="sect538">§ 538</a>. See the verses in the section on double
  rhymes. Here the original character of the measure is <i>x a</i>
  throughout, until we get to the words <i>disséver</i> and <i>for
  éver</i>, and afterwards to <i>men doúbt it</i>, and <i>aboút it</i>. At
  the first view it seems proper to say that in these last-mentioned cases
  <i>x a</i> is converted into <i>x a x</i>. A different view, however, is
  the more correct one. <i>Disséver</i> and <i>for éver</i>, are rather
  <i>x a</i> with a syllable over. This extra syllable may be expressed by
  the sign <i>plus</i> ( + ), so that the words in point may be expressed
  by <i>x a</i> +, rather than by <i>x a x</i>. It is very clear that a
  measure whereof the last syllable is accented (that is, measures like
  <i>x a</i>, <i>presúme</i>, or <i>x x a</i>, <i>cavalíer</i>), can only
  <!-- Page 379 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page379"></a>[379]</span>vary from their original character on the
  side of excess; that is, they can only be altered by the addition of
  fresh syllables. To subtract a syllable from such feet is impossible;
  since it is only the last syllable that is capable of being subtracted.
  If that last syllable, however, be the accented syllable of the measure,
  the whole measure is annihilated. Nothing remains but the unaccented
  syllable preceding; and this, as no measure can subsist without an
  accent, must be counted as a supernumerary part of the preceding
  measure.</p>

  <p><a name="sect539">§ 539</a>. With the measures <i>a x</i>, <i>a x
  x</i>, <i>x a x</i>, the case is different. Here there is room for
  syllable or syllables to be subtracted.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In all these lines the last measure is deficient in a syllable, yet
  the deficiency is allowable, because each measure is the last one of the
  line. The formula for expressing <i>faír</i>, <i>sléep</i>, <i>chaír</i>,
  &amp;c. is not <i>a</i>, but rather <i>a x</i> followed by the
  <i>minus</i> sign (-), or <i>a x-</i>.</p>

  <p>A little consideration will show that amongst the English measures,
  <i>x a</i> and <i>x x a</i> naturally form single, <i>a x</i> and <i>x a
  x</i> double, and <i>a x x</i> treble rhymes.</p>

  <p><a name="sect540">§ 540</a>. The chief metres in English are of the
  formula <i>x a</i>. It is only a few that are known by fixed names. These
  are as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. <i>Gay's stanza.</i>&mdash;Lines of three measures, <i>x a</i>,
  with alternate rhymes. The odd (<i>i.e.</i> the 1st and 3rd) rhymes
  double. <!-- Page 380 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  Elizabeth's reign. It admits of varieties according to the distribution
  of the first five rhymes.</p>

  <p>10. <i>Ottava rima.</i>&mdash;A metre with an Italian name, and
  borrowed from Italy, where it is used generally for narrative poetry. The
  Morgante Maggiore of Pulci, the Orlando Innamorato of Bojardo, the
  Orlando Furioso of Ariosto, the Gierusalemme Liberata of Tasso, are all
  written in this metre. Besides this, the two chief epics of Spain and
  Portugal respectively (the Auraucana and the Lusiados) are thus composed.
  Hence it is a form of poetry which is Continental rather than <!-- Page
  382 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page382"></a>[382]</span>English,
  and naturalized rather than indigenous. The stanza consists of eight
  lines of heroics, the six first rhyming alternately, the last two in
  succession.</p>

  <p>11. <i>Terza rima.</i>&mdash;Like the last, borrowed both in name and
  nature from the Italian, and scarcely yet naturalized in England.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>12. <i>Alexandrines.</i>&mdash;Six measures, <i>x a</i>, generally
  (perhaps always) with rhyme. The name is said to be taken from the fact
  that early romances upon the deeds of Alexander of Macedon, of great
  popularity, were written in this metre. One of the longest poems in the
  <!-- Page 383 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page383"></a>[383]</span>English language is in the Alexandrines,
  <i>viz.</i> Drayton's Poly-olbion, quoted above.</p>

  <p>13. <i>Spenserian stanza.</i>&mdash;A stanza consisting of nine lines,
  the first eight heroics, the last an Alexandrine.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">It hath been through all ages ever seen,</p>
      <p class="i4">That with the prize of arms and chivalrie</p>

      <p class="i4">For he meseems most fit the fair to serve</p>
      <p class="i2">That can her best defend from villanie;</p>
      <p class="i4">And she most fit his service doth deserve,</p>
      <p>That fairest is, and from her faith will never swerve.&mdash;<span class="sc">Spenser.</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Childe Harold and other important poems are composed in the Spenserian
  stanza.</p>

  <p>14. <i>Service metre.</i>&mdash;Couplets of seven measures, <i>x
  a</i>. This is the common metre of the Psalm versions. It is also called
  common measure, or long measure. In this metre there is always a pause
  after the fourth measure, and many grammarians consider that with that
  pause the line ends. According to this view, the service metre does not
  consist of two long lines with seven measures each; but of four short
  ones, with four and three measures each alternately. The Psalm versions
  are printed so as to exhibit this pause or break.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The Lord descended from above, | and bow'd the heavens most high,</p>
      <p>And underneath his feet He cast | the darkness of the sky.</p>
      <p>On Cherubs and on Seraphim | full royally He rode,</p>
      <p>And on the wings of mighty winds | came flying all abroad.&mdash;<span class="sc">Sternhold and Hopkins.</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In this matter the following distinction is convenient. When the last
  syllable of the fourth measure (<i>i.e.</i> the eighth syllable in the
  line) in the one verse <i>rhymes</i> with <!-- Page 384 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page384"></a>[384]</span>the corresponding
  syllable in the other, the long verse should be looked upon as broken up
  into two short ones; in other words, the couplets should be dealt with as
  a stanza. Where there is no rhyme except at the seventh measure, the
  verse should remain undivided. Thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Turn, gentle hermit of the glen, | and guide thy lonely way</p>
      <p>To where yon taper cheers the vale | with hospitable ray&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>constitute a single couplet of two lines, the number of rhymes being
  two. But,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Turn, gentle hermit of the dale,</p>
      <p class="i2">And guide thy lonely way</p>

  <p>constitute a stanza of four lines, the number of rhymes being
  four.</p>

  <p>15. <i>Ballad stanza.</i>&mdash;Service metre broken up in the way
  just indicated. Goldsmith's Edwin and Angelina, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>16. <i>Poulterer's measure.</i>&mdash;Alexandrines and service metre
  alternately. Found in the poetry of Henry the Eighth's time.</p>

<h3>PART VII.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE DIALECTS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</p>

  <p><a name="sect541">§ 541</a>. Certain parts of England are named as if
  their population were preeminently <i>Saxon</i> rather than <i>Angle</i>;
  <i>viz.</i>, Wes<i>-sex</i> ( = West <i>Saxons</i>), Es<i>-sex</i> ( =
  East <i>Saxons</i>), Sus<i>-sex</i> ( = South <i>Saxons</i>), and
  Middle<i>-sex</i>, ( = Middle <i>Saxons</i>).</p>

  <p>Others are named as if their population were preeminently <i>Angle</i>
  rather than <i>Saxon</i>; thus, the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk once
  constituted the kingdom of the East Angles, and even at the present
  moment, are often spoken of as <i>East Anglia</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect542">§ 542</a>. It is safe to say that the dialects of
  the English language do <i>not</i> coincide with the distribution of
  these terms. That parts of the Angle differ from parts of the Saxon
  districts in respect to the character of their provincialisms is true;
  but it is by no means evident that they differ on that account.</p>

  <p>Thus, that the dialect of Hampshire, which was part of Wes<i>-sex</i>,
  should differ from that of Norfolk, which was part of East <i>Anglia</i>,
  is but natural. There is a great space of country between them&mdash;a
  fact sufficient to account for their respective characteristics, without
  assuming an original difference of population. Between the <i>Saxons</i>
  of Es<i>-sex</i> and the <i>Anglians</i> of Suffolk, no one has professed
  to find any notable difference. <!-- Page 386 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page386"></a>[386]</span></p>

  <p>Hence, no division of the English dialects into those of <i>Saxon</i>
  or those of <i>Angle</i> origin, has been successful.</p>

  <p>Neither have any peculiarities in the dialect of Kent, or the Isle of
  Wight, verified the notion of the population for those parts having been
  originally <i>Jute</i>.</p>

  <p>Nor yet has any portion of England been shown by the evidence of its
  dialects, to have been <i>Frisian</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect543">§ 543</a>. Yet the solution of such problems is one
  of the great objects of the study of provincial modes of speech.</p>

  <p><a name="sect544">§ 544</a>. That <i>Jute</i> characteristics will be
  sought in vain is the inference from §§ <a href="#sect7">7</a>-<a
  href="#sect13">13</a>.</p>

  <p>That differential points between the <i>Angles</i> and <i>Saxons</i>
  will be sought in vain is also probable.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, differential points between the <i>Frisians</i> and
  <i>Angles</i> are likely to be discovered.</p>

  <p><a name="sect545">§ 545</a>. The traces of the Danes, or Northmen, are
  distinct; the following forms of local names being <i>primâ facie</i>
  evidence (at least) of Danish or Norse occupancy.</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> The combination <i>Sk-</i>, rather than the sound of
  <i>Sh-</i>, in such names as <i>Skip-</i>ton, rather than
  <i>Ship-</i>ton.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> The combination <i>Ca-</i>, rather than <i>Ch-</i>, in such
  names as <i>Carl-</i>ton rather than <i>Charl-</i>ton.</p>

  <p><i>c.</i> The termination <i>-by</i> ( = <i>town</i>,
  <i>habitation</i>, <i>occupancy</i>,) rather than <i>-ton</i>, as
  Ash<i>-by</i>, Demble<i>-by</i>, Spills<i>-by</i>, Grims<i>-by</i>,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>d.</i> The form <i>Kirk</i> rather than <i>Church</i>.</p>

  <p><i>e.</i> The form <i>Orm</i> rather than <i>Worm</i>, as in
  <i>Orms-head</i>.</p>

  <p>In <i>Orms-kirk</i> and <i>Kir-by</i> we have a combination of Danish
  characteristics.</p>

  <p><a name="sect546">§ 546</a>. In respect to their distribution, the
  Danish forms are&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- Page 387 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page387"></a>[387]</span></p>

  <p>At their <i>maximum</i> on the sea-coast of Lincolnshire; <i>i.e.</i>,
  in the parts about Spills-by.</p>

  <p>Common, but less frequent, in Yorkshire, the Northern counties of
  England, the South-eastern parts of Scotland, Lancashire,
  (<i>Ormskirk</i>, Horn-<i>by</i>), and parts of South Wales
  (<i>Orms</i>-head, Ten-<i>by</i>).</p>

  <p>In Orkney, and the northern parts of Scotland, the Norse had
  originally the same influence that the Anglo-Saxon had in the
  south.&mdash;See the chapter of the Lowland Scotch.</p>

  <p>This explains the peculiar distribution of the Norse forms. Rare, or
  non-existent, in central and southern England, they appear on the
  opposite sides of the island, and on its northern extremity; showing that
  the stream of the Norse population went <i>round the island rather than
  across it</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="sect547">§ 547</a>. Next to the search after traces of the
  original differences in the speech of the Continental invaders of Great
  Britain, the question as to the origin of the <i>written</i> language of
  England is the most important.</p>

  <p>Mr. Guest has given good reasons for believing it to have arisen out
  of a Mercian, rather than a West-Saxon dialect&mdash;although of the
  <i>Anglo-Saxon</i> the West-Saxon was the most cultivated form.</p>

  <p>This is confirmed by the present state of the Mercian dialects.</p>

  <p>The country about Huntingdon and Stamford is, in the mind of the
  present writer, that part of England where provincial peculiarities are
  at the <i>minimum</i>. This may be explained in various ways, of which
  none is preferable to the doctrine, that the dialect for those parts
  represents the dialect out of which the literary language of England
  became developed.</p>

  <p>Such are the chief problems connected with the study <!-- Page 388
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page388"></a>[388]</span>of the
  provincial dialects of England; the exhibition of the methods applicable
  to their investigation not being considered necessary in a work like the
  present.</p>

<p class="cenhead">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>That <i>Saxon</i> was the <i>British</i> name of the Germanic invaders
  of Great Britain is certain.&mdash;See § <a href="#sect45">45</a>.</p>

  <p>The reasons which induce me to consider it as <i>exclusively</i>
  British, <i>i.e.</i>, as foreign to the Angles, are as
  follows,&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>a.</i> No clear distinction has ever been drawn between,
  <i>e.g.</i>, an <i>Angle</i> of Suffolk, and a <i>Saxon</i> of Essex.</p>

  <p><i>b.</i> The Romans who knew, for some parts at least, every inch of
  the land occupied by the Saxons of Germany, as long as there is reason
  for believing that they took their names from German sources, never use
  the word. It is strange to Cæsar, Strabo, Pliny, and Tacitus. Ptolemy is
  the first who uses it.</p>

  <p><i>c.</i> Ecbert, who is said to have attached the name of

  <p><a name="endnote1" href="#endnotetag1">[1]</a> The immediate
  authority for these descents, dates, and localities is Sharon Turner.
  They are nearly the same as those which are noticed in Mr. Kemble's
  <i>Saxons in England</i>. In the former writer, however, they are given
  as historical facts; in the latter they are subjected to criticism, and
  considered as exceptionable.</p>

  <p><a name="endnote2" href="#endnotetag2">[2]</a> It is from Beda that
  the current opinions as to the details of the Anglo-Saxon invasion are
  taken; especially the threefold division into Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.
  These migrations were so large and numerous that the original country of
  the Angles was left a desert. The distribution of the three divisions
  over the different parts of England was also Beda's.</p>

  <p>The work of this important writer&mdash;the great luminary of early
  England&mdash;is the <i>Historia Ecclesiastica</i>, a title which
  prepares us for a great preponderance of the ecclesiastical over the
  secular history.</p>

  <p>Now Beda's date was the middle of the eighth century.</p>

  <p>And his locality was the monastery of Wearmouth, in the county of
  Durham.</p>

  <p>Both of these facts must be borne in mind when we consider the value
  of his authority, <i>i.e.</i>, his means of knowing, as determined by the
  conditions of time and place.</p>

  <p>Christianity was introduced among the Anglo-Saxons of Kent <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 597. For the times between them and <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 740, we have in Mr. Kemble's <i>Codex
  Diplomaticus</i> eighty-five charters, all in Latin, and most of them of
  uncertain authenticity. They are chiefly grants of different kings of
  Kent, Wessex, the Hwiccas, Mercia, and Northumberland, a few being of
  Bishops.</p>

  <p><a name="endnote3" href="#endnotetag3">[3]</a> Gildas was a
  <i>British</i> ecclesiastic, as Beda was an <i>English</i> one. <!-- Page
  394 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page394"></a>[394]</span>His
  locality was North Wales: his time earlier than Beda's by perhaps one
  hundred years.</p>

  <p>He states that he was born the year of the <i>pugna Badonica</i>,
  currently called the <i>Battle of Bath</i>.</p>

  <p>Now a chronological table called <i>Annales Cambrenses</i>, places
  that event within one hundred years of the supposed landing of
  Hengist.</p>

  <p>But there is no reason for believing this to be a cotemporary entry.
  Hence, all that can be safely said of Gildas is that he was about as far
  removed from the seat of the Germanic invasions, in locality, as Beda,
  whilst in point of time he was nearer.</p>

  <p>As a writer he is far inferior, being pre-eminently verbose, vague,
  and indefinite.</p>

  <p><i>Gildas</i>, as far as he states facts at all, gives the
  <i>British</i> account of the conquest.</p>

  <p>No other documents have come down to our time.</p>

  <p>Beda's own authorities&mdash;as we learn from his
  introduction&mdash;were certain of the most learned bishops and abbots of
  his cotemporaries, of whom he sought special information as to the
  antiquities of their own establishments. Of cotemporary writers, in the
  way of authority, there is no mention.</p>

  <p>For the times between the "accredited date of Hengist and Horsa's
  landing (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 449) and <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 597 (a period of about one hundred and fifty
  years) the only authorities are a few quotations from Solinus, Gildas,
  and a Legendary Life of St. Germanus."&mdash;<i>Saxons in Engl.</i> i.

  <p><a name="endnote4" href="#endnotetag4">[4]</a> This account is from
  Jornandes, who is generally considered as the chief repertory of the
  traditions respecting the Gothic populations. He lived about <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 530. The Gepidæ were said to be the
  <i>laggards</i> of the migration, and the vessel which carried them to
  have been left behind: and as <i>gepanta</i> in their language meant
  <i>slow</i>, their name is taken therefrom.</p>

  <p><a name="endnote5" href="#endnotetag5">[5]</a> Widukind was a monk of
  Corvey in Flanders, who wrote the Ecclesiastical History of his
  monastery.</p>

  <p><a name="endnote6" href="#endnotetag6">[6]</a> Geoffry of Monmouth,
  like Gildas, is a <i>British</i> authority. His date was the reign of
  Henry II. The <i>Welsh</i> traditions form the staple of Geoffry's work,
  for which it is the great repertory.</p>

  <p><a name="endnote7" href="#endnotetag7">[7]</a> The <i>date</i> of
  this was the reign of Marcus Antoninus. Its <i>place</i>, the Danubian
  provinces of Rhætia, and Pannonia. It was carried on by the Germans of
  the <i>frontier</i> or <i>march</i>&mdash;from whence the name&mdash;in
  alliance with the Jazyges, who were undoubtedly Slavonic, and the Quadi,
  who were probably so. Its details are obscure&mdash;the chief authority
  being Dio Cassius.</p>

  <p><a name="endnote8" href="#endnotetag8">[8]</a> The reign of
  Valentinian was from <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 365 to <span

  name="page395"></a>[395]</span></p>

  <p><a name="endnote9" href="#endnotetag9">[9]</a> The date of this has
  been variously placed in <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 438, and between
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 395 and <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  407. Either is earlier than <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 449.</p>

  <p><a name="endnote10" href="#endnotetag10">[10]</a> The Saxon Chronicle
  consists of a series of entries from the earliest times to the reign of
  King Stephen, each under its year: the year of the Anglo-Saxon invasion
  being the usual one, <i>i.e.</i>, <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 449. The
  value of such a work depends upon the extent to which the chronological
  entries are cotemporaneous with the events noticed. Where this is the
  case, the statement is of the highest historical value; where, however,
  it is merely taken from some earlier authority, or from a tradition, it
  loses the character of a <i>register</i>, and becomes merely a series of
  dates&mdash;correct or incorrect as the case may be. Where the
  Anglo-Saxon Chronicle really begins to be a cotemporaneous register is
  uncertain&mdash;all that is certain being that it <i>is</i> so for the
  <i>latest</i>, and is <i>not</i> so for <i>earliest</i> entries. The
  notices in question come under the former class. The Anglo-Saxon
  Chronicle had been edited by the Master of Trinity College, Oxford (Dr.
  Ingram), and analyzed by Miss Gurney.</p>

  <p><a name="endnote11" href="#endnotetag11">[11]</a> Asserius was a
  learned Welsh ecclesiastic who was invited by King Alfred into Wessex,
  and employed by that king as one of his associates and assistants in
  civilizing and instructing his subjects. Several works are mentioned as
  having been written by Asserius, but the only one extant is his history
  of King Alfred, which is a chronicle of various events between the year
  of Alfred's birth, <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 849, to <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 889.</p>

  <p>Asserius is supposed to have died Bishop of Sherborne, <span

  the Anglo-Saxon word <i>ware</i> = <i>occupants</i>, <i>inhabitants</i>,
  are too numerous to leave any doubt as to this, and several other,

  <p><a name="endnote18" href="#endnotetag18">[18]</a> Of the early
  constitution of states of East Friesland, we have a remarkable
  illustration in the old Frisian Laws. These are in the native Frisian
  tongue, and, except that they represent republican rather than
  monarchical institutions, are similar in form, in spirit, to the
  Saxon.</p>

  <p><a name="endnote19" href="#endnotetag19">[19]</a> The great blow
  against the sovereignty of Rome, and the one which probably prevented
  Germany from becoming a Roman province, was struck by the Cheruscan
  Arminius against Quintilius Varus, in the reign of Augustus. The date of
  the organized insurrection of Arminius was <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  9; the place, the neighbourhood of Herford, or Engern, in Westphalia.
  Drawn into an inpracticable part of the country, the troops of Varus were
  suddenly attacked and cut to pieces&mdash;consisting of more than three
  legions. "Never was victory more decisive, never was the liberation of an
  oppressed people more instantaneous and complete. Throughout Germany the
  Roman garrisons were assailed and cut off; and, within a few weeks after
  Varus had fallen, the German soil was freed from the foot of an
  invader.</p>

  <p>"Had Arminius been supine or unsuccessful, our Germanic ancestors
  would have been enslaved or exterminated in their original seats along
  the Eyder and the Elbe. This island would never have borne the name of

  the gerund from <i>helian</i> = <i>heal</i>, and means <i>the Healer</i>
  or <i>Saviour</i>. It is the name of an old Saxon poem, in alliterative
  metre, of the tenth or eleventh century, in the dialect supposed to have
  belonged to the parts about Essen, Cleves, and Munster in Westphalia. It
  is a sort of Gospel Harmony, or Life of Christ, taken from the Gospels.
  It has been edited by Schmeller.</p>

  <p><a name="endnote21" href="#endnotetag21">[21]</a> Hildubrand and
  Hathubrant, father and son, are two legendary heroes belonging to that
  cycle of German fiction of which Theodoric of Verona is the centre. A
  fragment containing an account of their hostile meeting, being mutually
  unknown, in alliterative metre, represents the <i>fictional</i> poetry of
  the old Saxons in the same way (though not to the same extent) that the
  Heliand represents their sacred poetry. The "Hildubrand and Hathubrant"
  have been edited by Grimm.</p>

  <p><a name="endnote22" href="#endnotetag22">[22]</a> In a language which
  for a long time was considered to be the Dutch of Holland in its oldest
  known form, there is an imperfect translation of the Psalms; referred by
  the best writers on the subject to the reign of Charlemagne, and thence
  called the Carolinian Psalms. The best text of this is to be found in a
  Dutch periodical, the <i>Taalkundig Magazijn</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="endnote23" href="#endnotetag23">[23]</a> <i>Beowulf</i> is
  by far the most considerable poem, not only in Anglo-Saxon, but in any
  old Gothic tongue. It has been admirably edited and translated by Mr.
  Kemble. The subject is the account of Beowulf, an Angle hero&mdash;Angle
  but not English, as the scene of the poem is on the Continent. In its
  present form it shows traces of the revision of some Christian writer:
  the basis, however, of its subject, and the manners it describes, are
  essentially Pagan. The most remarkable feature in the poem is the fact
  that no allusion is made to England&mdash;so that, <i>Anglo</i>-Saxon as
  the work is&mdash;it belongs to the Anglo-Saxons of Germany before they
  became English.</p>

<h2>Elements of Moral Philosophy:</h2>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">ANALYTICAL, SYNTHETICAL, AND PRACTICAL.</span></p>

<p class="cenhead">BY HUBBARD WINSLOW.</p>

<p class="cenhead">12mo. 480 pages. Price $1 50.</p>

  <p>This work is an original and thorough examination of the fundamental
  laws of Moral Science, and of their relations to Christianity and to
  practical life. It has already taken a firm stand among our highest works
  of literature and science. From the numerous commendations of it by our
  most learned and competent men, we have room for only the following brief
  extracts:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead"><i>From the </i><span class="sc">Rev. Thomas H. Skinner, D.D.</span><i>, of the Union Theol. Sem., N.Y.</i></p>

  <p>"It is a work of uncommon merit, on a subject very difficult to be
  treated well. His analysis is complete. He has shunned no question which
  his purpose required him to answer, and he has met no adversary which he
  has not overcome."</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">Rev. L. P. Hickok</span><i>, Vice-President of Union College.</i></p>

  <p>"I deem the book well adapted to the ends proposed in the preface. The
  style is clear, the thoughts perspicuous. I think it calculated to do
  good, to promote the truth, to diffuse light and impart instruction to
  the community, in a department of study of the deepest interest to
  mankind."</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">Rev. James Walker, D.D.</span><i>, President of Harvard University.</i></p>

  <p>"Having carefully examined the more critical parts, to which my
  attention has been especially directed, I am free to express my
  conviction of the great clearness, discrimination, and accuracy of the
  work, and of its admirable adaptation to its object."</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">Rev. Ray Palmer, D.D.</span><i>, of Albany.</i></p>

  <p>"I have examined this work with great pleasure, and do not hesitate to
  say that in my judgment it is greatly superior to any treatise I have
  seen, in all the essential requisites of a good text-book."</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">Prof. Rousseau D. Hitchcock, D.D.</span><i>, of Union Theol. Sem., N.Y.</i></p>

  <p>"The task of mediating between science and the popular mind, is one
  that requires a peculiar gift of perspicuity, both in thought and style;
  and this, I think, the author possesses in an eminent degree. I am
  pleased with its comprehensiveness, its plainness, and its fidelity to
  the Christian stand-point."</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">Prof. Henry B. Smith, D.D.</span><i>, of the Union Theol. Sem., N.Y.</i></p>

  <p>"It commends itself by its clear arrangement of the topics, its
  perspicuity of language, and its constant practical bearings. I am
  particularly pleased with its views of conscience. Its frequent and
  pertinent illustrations, and the Scriptural character of its explanations
  of the particular duties, will make the work both attractive and valuable
  as a text-book, in imparting instruction upon this vital part of
  philosophy."</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">W. D. Wilson, D.D.</span><i>, Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy in
Hobart Free College.</i></p>

  <p>"I have examined the work with care, and have adopted it as a
  text-book in the study of Moral Science. I consider it not only sound in
  doctrine, but clear and systematic in method, and withal pervaded with a
  prevailing healthy tone of sentiment, which cannot fail to leave behind,
  in addition to the truths it inculcates, an impression in favor of those
  truths. I esteem this one of the greatest merits of the book. In this
  respect it has no equal, so far as I know; and I do not hesitate to speak
  of it as being preferable to any other work yet published, for use in all
  institutions where Moral Philosophy forms a department in the course of
  instruction."</p>

<h2>A History of Philosophy:</h2>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">AN EPITOME.</span></p>

<p class="cenhead">BY DR. ALBERT SCHWEGLER.</p>

<p class="cenhead">TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL GERMAN, BY JULIUS H. SEELYE.</p>

<p class="cenhead">12mo. 365 pages. Price $1 50.</p>

  <p>This translation is designed to supply a want long felt by both
  teachers and students in our American colleges. We have valuable
  histories of Philosophy in English, but no <i>manual</i> on this subject
  so clear, concise, and comprehensive as the one now presented.
  Schwegler's work bears the marks of great learning, and is evidently
  written by one who has not only studied the original sources for such a
  history, but has thought out for himself the systems of which he treats.
  He has thus seized upon the real germ of each system, and traced its
  process of development with great clearness and accuracy. The whole
  history of speculation, from Thales to the present time, is presented in
  its consecutive order. This rich and important field of study, hitherto
  so greatly neglected, will, it is hoped, receive a new impulse among
  American students through Mr. Seelye's translation. It is a book,
  moreover, invaluable for reference, and should be in the possession of
  every public and private library.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">L. P. Hickok</span><i>, Vice-President of Union College.</i></p>

  <p>"I have had opportunity to hear a large part of Rev. Mr. Seelye's
  translation of Schwegler's History of Philosophy read from manuscript,
  and I do not hesitate to say that it is a faithful, clear, and remarkably
  precise English rendering of this invaluable Epitome of the History of
  Philosophy. It is exceedingly desirable that it should be given to
  American students of philosophy in the English language, and I have no
  expectation of its more favorable and successful accomplishment than in
  this present attempt. I should immediately introduce it as as a text-book
  in the graduate's department under my own instruction, if it be favorably
  published, and cannot doubt that other teachers will rejoice to avail
  themselves of the like assistance from it."</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">Henry B. Smith</span><i>, Professor of Christian Theology, Union Theological
Seminary, N.Y.</i></p>

  <p>"It will well reward diligent study, and is one of the best works for
  a text-book in our colleges upon this neglected branch of scientific
  investigation."</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">N. Porter</span><i>, Professor of Intellectual Philosophy in Yale College.</i></p>

  <p>"It is the only book translated from the German which professes to
  give an account of the recent German systems which seems adapted to give
  any intelligible information on the subject to a novice."</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">Geo. P. Fisher</span><i>, Professor of Divinity in Yale College.</i></p>

  <p>"It is really the best Epitome of the History of Philosophy now
  accessible to the English student."</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">Joseph Haven</span><i>, Professor of Mental Philosophy in Amherst College.</i></p>

  <p>"As a manual and brief summary of the whole range of speculative
  inquiry, I know of no work which strikes me more favorably."</p>

<h2>A Digest of English Grammar.</h2>

<p class="cenhead">BY L. T. COVELL.</p>

<p class="cenhead">12mo. 219 pages. Price 60 cents.</p>

  <p>This work is designed as a text-book for the use of schools and
  academies; it is the result of long experience of an eminently successful
  teacher, and will be found to possess many peculiar advantages.</p>

  <p>The work is both synthetical and analytical, and its principles are
  strictly practical; the different subjects are carefully separated and
  methodically arranged, so that all difficulty as to what belongs to
  Etymology, Syntax, and Analysis, is entirely removed, and the latter,
  which is very properly placed in the first part of Syntax, is rendered
  quite as simple and easy of comprehension as the most plain portion of
  grammar.</p>

  <p>One subject is taken up at a time, and, when fully explained, models
  of Analysis are given, and examples for practice follow.</p>

  <p>The principles of the work are sound; the definitions are direct,
  short, and accurate.</p>

  <p>The rules, though ample, are few, plain, and concise; and the language
  throughout the work is simple, clear, and expressive.</p>

  <p>The method of treating the Elementary Sounds, is that which is now
  highly approved.</p>

  <p>The principles of Derivation, and of Orthographic Analysis, are
  brought within the comprehension of the youngest learner.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead"><i>From Forty-four Teachers of Public Schools, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.</i></p>

  <p>"The undersigned have examined Covell's Digest of English Grammar, and
  are of opinion that in the justness of its general views, the excellence
  of its style, the brevity, accuracy, and perspicuity of its definitions
  and rules, the numerous examples and illustrations, the adaptation of its
  synthetical exercises, the simplicity of its method of analysis, and in
  the plan of its arrangement, this work surpasses any other Grammar now
  before the public; and that in all respects it is most admirably adapted
  to the use of schools and academies."</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">John M. Wolcott, A.M.</span><i>, Principal and Superintendent of Ninth
Ward School, Pittsburg, Pa.</i></p>

  <p>"Covell's Digest of English Grammar not only evinces the most
  unceasing labor, the most extensive research, the most unrelaxing effort,
  and the most devoted self-sacrificing study of its author, but it is the
  most complete, the most perfect, and, to me, the most satisfactory
  exposition of English Grammar that has come to my notice. It appears to
  me that every youth aspiring to become master of the English language,
  from the rudimental principles to the full, round, beautiful, faultless,
  perfect period, will make this volume his '<i>vade mecum</i>.'"</p>

<h2>Class-Book of Physiology.</h2>

<p class="cenhead">BY B. N. COMINGS, M. D.,</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">PROFESSOR OF PHYSIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, AND NATURAL HISTORY, IN CONNECTICUT STATE NORMAL SCHOOL.</span></p>

<p class="cenhead">12mo. 324 pages. Price $1 25.</p>

<p class="cenhead">REVISED EDITION, WITH AN APPENDIX.</p>

  <p>Professor Comings' thorough acquaintance with every department of
  Physiology, and his long experience as a teacher of that science, qualify
  him in an eminent degree for preparing an accurate and useful text-book
  on the subject. He has lost no opportunity of introducing practical
  instructions in the principles of hygiene, thus not only making the pupil
  acquainted with the wondrous workmanship of his own frame, but showing
  him how to preserve it in a sound and healthy state. Avoiding technical
  terms, as far as possible, he has brought the subject fully within the
  comprehension of the young, and has clothed it with unusual interest, by
  judicious references to the comparative physiology of the inferior
  animals. Pictorial illustrations have been freely introduced, wherever it
  was thought they could aid or interest the student.</p>

  <p>Physiology cannot but be considered, by every intelligent and
  reflecting mind, an exceedingly interesting and necessary study. It makes
  us acquainted with the structure and uses of the organs of life, and the
  laws by which we may keep them active and vigorous for the longest
  period. The publishers would respectfully urge its importance on such
  teachers as have not heretofore made it a regular branch in their
  institutions; and would solicit, at the hands of all, an impartial
  examination of what is pronounced by good judges, "the best elementary
  text-book" on the science.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">M. Y. Brown</span><i>, Principal of Webster School, New Haven.</i></p>

  <p>"I have used Comings' Class-Book of Physiology for nearly two school
  terms in the First Department of my school. I am happy to say that I
  regard it the <i>best text-book</i> on this important branch with which I
  have any acquaintance. The subjects are systematically arranged; the
  principles, facts, and illustrations are clearly and fully represented to
  the pupil. I find that his introduction of Comparative Anatomy and
  Physics, tends greatly to increase the interest of the pupil in this
  <i>most important</i> and necessary study. I therefore can cheerfully

  and variety that of any other work of the kind which has come under my
  notice."</p>

  <p>Messrs. G. &amp;. C. Merriam:&mdash;Gentlemen, I have just had the
  honor of receiving the noble volume in which you and the great
  lexicographer, and the accomplished reviser, unite your labors to "bid
  the language live." I accept it with the highest pride and pleasure, and
  beg to adopt in its utmost strength and extent, the testimonial of Daniel
  Webster.</p>

  <p>Unquestionably the very best Dictionary of our language extant. Its
  great accuracy in the definition and derivation of words, gives it an
  authority that no other work on the subject possesses. It is constantly
  cited and relied on in our Courts of Justice, in our legislative bodies,
  and in public discussions, as entirely conclusive.</p>

  <p>Webster's great Dictionary may be regarded as bearing the same
  relation to the English language which Newton's "<i>Principia</i>" does
  to the sublime science of Natural Philosophy.</p>

  <p>There is no American scholar who does not feel proud of the labors of

  will not readily admit the great and distinctive merits of his
  Dictionary.</p>

  <p>Of the book itself I hear but one opinion from all around me, and do

  improvement in our time, unnecessary in its department of
  instruction.</p>

  school-books, by <span class="sc">G. P. Quackenbos, A. M.</span> They
  have stood the test of criticism, and have become acknowledged standards
  on the subjects of which they respectively treat. The secret of their
  success is their perfect adaptation in style, language, and development
  of the subject, to the pupil's comprehension. It is this that wins for
  them a general introduction, and makes them special favorites with both
  teacher and scholar.</p>

  <p>This work is an eminently clear and practical text-book, and embraces
  a variety of important subjects, which have a common connection, and
  mutually illustrate each other; but which the pupil has heretofore been
  obliged to leave unlearned, or to search for among a number of different
  volumes. Claiming to give a comprehensive and practical view of our
  language in all its relations, this "Advanced Course" views it as a
  whole, no less than with reference to the individual words composing it;
  shows how it compares with other tongues; points out its beauties;
  indicates how they may best be made available; and, in a word, teaches
  the student the most philosophical method of digesting his thoughts, as
  well as the most effective mode of expressing them.</p>

  <p>It teaches Rhetoric not merely theoretically, like the old textbooks,
  but <i>practically</i>, illustrating every point with exercises to be
  prepared by the student, which at once test his familiarity with the
  principles laid down, and impress them on his mind so vividly that they
  can never be effaced.</p>

  <p>Hon. <span class="sc">A. Constantine Barry</span>, State
  Superintendent of the Common Schools of Wisconsin, in a Report to the
  Legislature of that State, uses the following strong language in relation
  to <span class="sc">Quackenbos's</span> works on Composition:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It would be difficult to point out in these admirable books any thing
  that we would desire to have altered; they meet our wants in every
  respect, making no unreasonable draft on the time or patience of the
  teacher, and leaving him no excuse for neglecting to make composition a
  regular study, even with his younger classes. It is unnecessary to
  compare these books with others on the subject, for <span
  class="scac">THERE ARE NONE THAT APPROACH THEM</span> in clearness,
  comprehensiveness, excellence of arrangement, and above all, in direct
  practical bearing. Affording an insight into the mechanism of language,
  they will hardly fail to impart facility and grace of expression, and to
  inspire a love for the beauties of literature."</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">Prof. John N. Pratt</span><i>, of the University of Alabama.</i></p>

  <p>"I have been using <span class="sc">Quackenbos</span> on Composition
  and Rhetoric in the instruction of my classes in the University, and I am
  persuaded of its <span class="scac">GREAT EXCELLENCE</span>. The First
  Lessons in Composition, by the same author, I regard as very useful for
  beginners. Of these two books, I can speak with the greatest confidence,
  and I do <span class="scac">MOST HEARTILY RECOMMEND THEM</span> to
  all."</p>

<h2>Illustrated School History</h2>

<h3>OF THE UNITED STATES,</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">From the Earliest Discoveries to the Present Time: embracing a Full Account of the Aborigines, Biographical Notice of Distinguished Men, and Numerous Maps, Plans of Battle-fields, and Pictorial Illustrations.</span></p>

<p class="cenhead">BY G. P. QUACKENBOS, A. M.</p>

<p class="cenhead">12mo. 473 pages. Price $1 25.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The Author has aimed to be <i>simple</i>, that youth of lower as well
  as advanced classes may understand him; <i>clear</i>, that no indistinct
  or erroneous impressions may be conveyed; <i>accurate</i> in the recital
  of facts; and <i>interesting</i> as regards both matter and style.
  Avoiding fragmentary statements, he has gone into detail sufficiently to
  show events in their connections, convinced that a fairer idea of them is
  thus imparted, and that facts otherwise dry may in this way be made
  attractive and indelibly impressed on the mind. He has tried throughout
  to be fair and national. He has neither introduced offensive allusions,
  nor invidiously attempted to bias the minds of the young on controverted
  questions connected with politics or religion.</p>

  <p>The pronunciation of all difficult and foreign names is given in
  brackets; and appropriate illustrations have been liberally provided.
  Maps are as useful in history as in geography, and plans are often
  essential to the lucid delineation of military movements. Both are here
  presented wherever it was thought they would be of service.</p>

  <p>In elegance of style, accuracy clearness, interest of narrative,
  richness of illustration, and adaptation to the school-room, this History
  is pronounced far in advance of every similar work heretofore
  published.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">Prof. H. D. Lathrop</span><i>, Gambier, Ohio.</i></p>

  <p>It seems to me admirably adapted to the purpose intended. The style is
  simple and attractive, the narrative accurate and sufficiently minute,
  the illustrations appropriate and elegant, and the typographical
  execution all that could be desired.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">J. D. H. Corwine</span><i>, Principal Kentucky Liberal Institute.</i></p>

  <p>I shall at once introduce it as <i>the best-work of the kind</i> on
  this important branch of education.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">Rev. Joseph Shackelford</span><i>, Principal Institute, Moulton, Ala.</i></p>

  <p>I think it superior to many that I have examined as a school-book. I
  have been using Wilson's, but I think this is a much better book for
  schools.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>From </i><span class="sc">Rev. Charles Reynolds</span><i>, Rector of Trinity Church, Columbus, Ohio.</i></p>

  <p>It is a most delightful volume, and were I teaching a dozen classes in
  United States History, I would use no other book but yours.</p>
